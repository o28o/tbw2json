    "an4.275:1": "\"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, four things are to be developed. What four? () Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states … (3) … for the arising of unarisen wholesome states … (4) … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. For direct knowledge of lust, these four things are to be developed.\""
