    "an10.95:1": "Then the wanderer Uttiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:",
    "an10.95:2": "() \"Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?\"",
    "an10.95:3": "() –(4) \"How is it then, Master Gotama, is the world finite? … Is the world infinite? … (5) –(6) Are the soul and the body the same? … Is the soul one thing, the body another? … (7) –(10) Does the Tathāgata exist after death? … Does the Tathāgata not exist after death? … Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death? … Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?\"",
    "an10.95:4": "\"When I asked you: ‘How is it, Master Gotama, is the world eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?’ you said: ‘Uttiya, I have not declared: \"The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.\"’",
    "an10.95:5": "But when I asked you: ‘Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?’ you said: ‘Uttiya, I also have not declared: \"The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.\"’",
    "an10.95:7": "\"Through direct knowledge, Uttiya, I teach the Dhamma to my disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna.\"",
    "an10.95:8": "\"But when Master Gotama, through direct knowledge, teaches the Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna, will the entire world be thereby emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world?\"",
    "an10.95:9": "When this was asked, the Blessed One remained silent. Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: \"The wanderer Uttiya had better not adopt the evil view: ‘When I ask the ascetic Gotama the most elevated question of all, he falters and does not answer.[n.2128]Mp:\"The most elevated question of all: ‘Do not let him acquire the bad view: \"When I ask the ascetic Gotama the ultimate question, he falters and does not reply. Is it the case that he isn’t up to the mark and cannot answer?\"’\"It must be that he is unable to do so.’ This would lead to the wanderer Uttiya's harm and suffering for a long time.\"",
    "an10.95:10": "Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the wanderer Uttiya: \"Well then, friend Uttiya, I will give you a simile. Some intelligent people here understand the meaning of what is said by means of a simile. Suppose a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts, walls, and arches, and with a single gate. The gatekeeper posted there would be wise, competent, and intelligent; one who keeps out strangersand admits acquaintances. While he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through. He might not know how many living beings enter or leave the city, but he could be sure that whatever large living beings enter or leave the city all enter and leave through that gate.",
    "an10.95:11": "So too, friend Uttiya, the Tathāgata has no concern whether the entire world will be emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world. But he can be sure that all those who have been emancipated, or who are being emancipated, or who will be emancipated from the world first abandon the five hindrances, corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom, and then, with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment. It is in this way that they have been emancipated or are being emancipated or will be emancipated from the world."
