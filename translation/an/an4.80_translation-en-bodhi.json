Theydo not engage in business(na kammantaṁ payojeti), in major work such as agriculture, trade, and so forth. Theydo not go to Kamboja(na kambojaṁ gacchati): they do not go to the Kamboja country for the purpose of carrying goods. This is the mere heading. The sense is that they do not go to any remote country.\""
