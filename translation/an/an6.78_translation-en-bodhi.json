    "an6.78:1": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu abounds in happiness and joy in this very life, and he has laid the foundation for the destruction of the taints. What six? Here, a bhikkhu delights in the Dhamma, delights inmentaldevelopment, delights in abandoning, delights in solitude, delights in non-affliction, and delights in non-proliferation. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu abounds in happiness and joy in this very life, and he has laid the foundation for the destruction of the taints.\""
