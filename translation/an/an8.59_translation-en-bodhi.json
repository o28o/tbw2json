    "an8.59:1": "\"Bhikkhus, these eight persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight? The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship.[n.757] Text here hasarahattaphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno, whereasAN8.9hasarahattāya paṭipanno.These eight persons, bhikkhus, are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.\"",
    "an8.59:2": "The four practicing the way[n.1758] The verses are also at SN11:16, I 33.and the four established in the fruit:this is the upright Saṅgha—composed in wisdom and virtuous behavior.[n.1759]Paññāsīlasamāhito.Mpglosses:paññāya ca sīlena ca samannāgato. Though this takessamāhitoto mean \"possessing\" rather than attainment ofsamādhi, by translating it as \"composed\" we can see how the word indirectly refers tosamādhi.",
    "an8.59:3": "For people intent on sacrifice,for living beings seeking merit,making merit that ripens in the acquisitions,[n.1760]Karotaṁ opadhikaṁ puññaṁ. The wordopadhikaṁmeans that the merit ripens inupadhi, a future acquisition of the five aggregates, and that the deed conduces to well-being in the round of rebirths rather than to liberation.what is given to the Saṅgha bears great fruit."
