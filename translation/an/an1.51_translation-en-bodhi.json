    "an1.51:1": "\"Luminous, bhikkhus, is this mind, but it is defiled by adventitious defilements. The uninstructed worldling does not understand this as it really is; therefore I say that for the uninstructed worldling there is no development of the mind.\"[n.47] The Nikāyas often set up a contrast between the \"uninstructed worldling\"(assutavā puthujjana), the common person of the world who lacks training in the Buddha’s teaching, and the instructed noble disciple(sutavā ariya sāvaka), who has learned the teaching and undertaken the training. More broadly, aputhujjanais anyone who has not yet reached the path of stream-entry(sotāpatti). Anariyasāvakais not necessarily a \"noble one\" in the technical sense, but any disciple, monastic or layperson, who has learned the teaching and earnestly takes up the practice."
