    "an4.116:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are four occasions when heedfulness should be practiced. What four?",
    "an4.116:2": "\"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has abandoned bodily misconduct and developed bodily good conduct; when he has abandoned verbal misconduct and developed verbal good conduct; when he has abandoned mental misconduct and developed mental good conduct; when he has abandoned wrong view and developed right view, then he need not fear death in the future.\"[n.797]So na bhāyati samparāyikassa maraṇassa.Mp:\"Arahants do not fear death either in the future or in this present life. They alone are intended here. Some, however, say that because of the statement, ‘developed right view,’ all noble ones from the stream-enterer up are intended.\" I am not sure thatsamparāyikassa maraṇassameans death in a future life, asMpimplicitly understands it. I take it to mean simply \"death in the future,\" referring primarily to one's future in this present life."
