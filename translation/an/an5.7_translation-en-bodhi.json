    "an5.7:1": "\"Bhikkhus, beings for the most part are captivated by sensual pleasures. When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith. For what reason? Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures.",
    "an5.7:2": "\"So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith incultivatingwholesome qualities, in a sense of shame incultivatingwholesome qualities, in moral dread incultivatingwholesome qualities, in energy incultivatingwholesome qualities, and in wisdom incultivatingwholesome qualities, I must still look after him. But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith incultivatingwholesome qualities … accomplished in wisdom incultivatingwholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking: ‘The bhikkhu can now look after himself. He won’t be heedless.’\"[n.978]Mp:\"This is said regarding one established in the fruit of stream-entry.\""
