    "an6.93:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these six cases of incapability. What six? One accomplished in view is () incapable of considering any conditioned phenomenon as permanent; (2) incapable of considering any conditioned phenomenon as pleasurable; (3) incapable of considering any phenomenon as a self; (4) incapable of doing a grave act that brings immediate result;[n.44]Ceand Beānantariyaṁ kammaṁ; Eeanantariyaṁ kammaṁ. Strangely, though this term commonly occurs in doctrinal expositions of Buddhism, a search for it in CST 4.0 turns up only one occurrence in the entire Sutta Piṭaka, namely, this one. The expression also occurs in the Vinaya Piṭaka, but only once, in the Devadatta story at Vin II 93,37. Anānantariya kammais understood to be a grave misdeed that in the immediately following existence necessarily produces a rebirth in hell. The five acts that constitute this type of kamma are mentioned atAN5.29,AN6.87, and just below atAN6.94.(5) incapable of resorting tothe beliefthat purity comes about through superstitious and auspicious acts; (6) incapable of seeking a person worthy of offerings outside here.[n.442]Ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyaṁ gavesituṁ. That is, incapable of seeking a person of noble attainment outside the Buddha’s teaching.These are the six cases of incapability.\""
