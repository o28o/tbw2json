He is not devoid of lust for form, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it …. Having eaten as much as he wants until his belly is full, he is intent upon the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep …. He lives the spiritual life aspiring forrebirth ina certain order of devas,thinking: ‘By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will be a deva or onein the retinueof the devas.’ When he lives the spiritual life aspiring forrebirth ina certain order of devas … his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … and striving, this is the fifth bondage of the mind.",
