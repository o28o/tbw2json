    "an2.151:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of munificence.[n.329]Santhāra.Mpexplains this as if it meant \"a covering\" or \"a spread,\" which it does in certain contexts: \"The covering with material goods is spreading out by covering (the space) between oneself and others with the four requisites.\" More likely, however,santhārahere is nearly synonymous withpaṭisanthāra, which occurs in the next sutta. In fact, Mp says that the difference between the two words is a mere prefix.What two? Munificence with material goods and munificence with the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of munificence. Of these two kinds of munificence, munificence with the Dhamma is foremost.\""
