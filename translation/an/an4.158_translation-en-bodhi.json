    "an4.158:1": "There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: \"Friends,bhikkhus!\"",
    "an4.158:2": "\"Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.’ What four? An abundance of lust, an abundance of hatred, an abundance of delusion, and his wisdom eye does not tread in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible.[n.84] Ee reads here:gambhīresu…ṭhānaṭṭhānesu, which might be translated \"various deep matters.\" It could be thatṭhānaṭṭhānesuwas the more original reading, which was altered toṭhānāṭṭhānesuunder the influence of this more common expression. But sinceMpcomments as if the latter were the reading, it is clear thatṭhānāṭṭhānesugoes back at least to the age of the commentator. AtMN 115.1–18, III 64–67, the Buddha explains how a bhikkhu is \"skilled in what is possible and impossible\"(ṭhānāṭhānakusalo).Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.’",
    "an4.158:3": "\"Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.’ What four? The diminishing of lust, the diminishing of hatred, the diminishing of delusion, and his wisdom eye treads in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible. Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: ‘I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.’\""
