    "an9.93:1": "\"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, nine things are to be developed. What nine? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of the repulsiveness of food, the perception of non-delight in the entire world, the perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, the perception of non-self in what is suffering, the perception of abandoning, and the perception of dispassion. For direct knowledge of lust, these nine things are to be developed.\""
