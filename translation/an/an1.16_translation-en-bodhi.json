    "an1.16:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen sensual desire does not arise and arisen sensual desire is abandoned so much as the mark of the unattractive.[n.29]Mpidentifies the \"mark of the unattractive\"(asubhanimitta)with the first jhāna arisen on the basis of any of the ten unattractive objects(dasasu asubhesu uppannaṁ sārammaṇaṁ paṭhamajjhānaṁ). This explanation relies on the Vism scheme, which takes theasubhaobjects to be corpses in stages of decomposition (see Vism 78–93, Ppn 6.–80). While we do find meditation on decaying corpses in the Nikāyas (seeAN.480–84), more typically the suttas explain the perception of the unattractive(asubhasaññā)as meditation on the thirty-one components of the body (increased to thirty-two in later works by adding the brain). See, for example,AN0.60, on the perception of unattractiveness. This perception occurs among a group of five meditation subjects that culminate in the deathless (AN5.6), that lead to nibbāna (AN5.69) and to the destruction of the taints (AN5.70), and that bring liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom (AN5.7). AtAN7.49, the perception of unattractiveness is recommended as the antidote to sexual desire, and atAN9.andAN9.3it is prescribed for the abandoning of lust.For one who attends carefully to the mark of the unattractive, unarisen sensual desire does not arise and arisen sensual desire is abandoned.\"[n.30] In line with the commentary to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (at Sv III 778–82, Ps I 282–86),Mpenumerates six things that lead to the abandoning of each of the five hindrances. The six that lead to the abandoning of sensual desire are: learning an unattractive object, meditation on an unattractive object, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating, good friendship, and suitable conversation."
