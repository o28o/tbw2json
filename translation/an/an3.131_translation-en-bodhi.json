    "an3.131:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three things that flourish when concealed, not when exposed. What three? () Women flourish when concealed, not when exposed.[n.599] The exact import of this is not clear to me. Perhaps the sense is that women are best kept within the home rather than permitted to go out in public places on their own. The Chinese parallel,EĀ22.4 (at T II 607b26–607c), is exactly like the Pāli, though it includes a verse which simply reiterates the same statements as in the prose portion of the sutta.(2) The hymns of the brahmins flourish when concealed, notwhen exposed. (3) And wrong views flourish when concealed, not when exposed. These are the three things that flourish when concealed, not when exposed.",
    "an3.131:2": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three things that shine when exposed, not when concealed. What three? (1) The moon shines when exposed, not when concealed. () The sun shines when exposed, not when concealed. (3) The Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata shines when exposed, not when concealed. These are the three things that shine when exposed, not when concealed.\""
