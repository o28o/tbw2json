    "an6.104:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of non-self in all phenomena. What six? () ‘I will be without identification in the entire world.[n.448]Sabbaloke atammayo bhavissāmi.Mp:\"Identification(tammayo)is craving and views; non-identification(atammayo)is their absence.\"(2) I-makings will cease for me. (3) Mine-makings will cease for me. (4) I will come to possess knowledge not sharedwith worldlings. (5) I will have clearly seen causation. And (6) I will have clearly seen causally arisen phenomena.’"
