    "an2.80:1": "\"Bhikkhus, bad unwholesome qualities arise through causal activities, not without causal activities. With the abandoning of these causal activities, these bad unwholesome qualities do not occur.\"[n.308] I follow the arrangement in Be and Ee. Ce does not place this sutta here, but because the key word issasaṅkhārā, inserts it below, as the fourth among the suttas on the five aggregates. It seems that the text available to the commentator corresponded with Be, forMp(both Ce and Be) explains thatnimitta,nidāna,hetu,saṅkhāra, andpaccayaare synonymous."
