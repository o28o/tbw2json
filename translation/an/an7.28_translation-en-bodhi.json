    "an7.28:1": "\"Bhikkhus, these seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What seven? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating; and when there are matters pertaining to the Saṅgha that areto be dealt within the Saṅgha, the bhikkhu who is a trainee does not reflect thus:[n.48] Reading withEena iti paṭisañcikkhati. Ce and Be omitna. Brahmāli suggests \"he is supposed to leave this work for thetheras(elders), who are expected to look after it.\"‘There are in the Saṅgha elders of long standing, long gone forth, responsible, who will take responsibility for thatwork.’ He himself undertakes them.[n.482]Ceattanā voyogaṁ āpajjati; Eeattanā vo yogaṁ āpajjati; Beattanā tesu yogaṁ āpajjati. Again, I follow Brahmāli's interpretation: \"Since it is the task of these elders, they will have to take ultimate responsibility (and the blame or praise) no matter who carries it out. Thus he should leave it to them.\"These seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.",
    "an7.28:2": "\"Bhikkhus, these seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What seven?Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating; and when there are matters pertaining to the Saṅgha that areto be dealt within the Saṅgha, the bhikkhu who is a trainee reflects thus: ‘There are in the Saṅgha elders of long standing, long gone forth, responsible, who will take responsibility for thatwork.’ He does not himself undertake them. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.\""
