What six? Sensual thought, the thought of ill will, the thought of harming, sensual perception, perception of ill will, and perception of harming. Possessing these six things, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him.",

What six? The thought of renunciation, the thought of good will, the thought of harmlessness, perception of renunciation, perception of good will, and perception of harmlessness. Possessing these six things, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life—without distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected for him.\""
