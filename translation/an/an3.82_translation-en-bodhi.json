    "an3.82:1": "\"Bhikkhus, suppose a donkey was following right behind a herd of cattle,thinking: ‘I’m a cow too, I’m a cow too.’[n.59]Ceahampamhā,ahampamhā; Ee, virtually the same, merely resolves thesandhi:aham pi amhā,aham pi amhā. Be'saham pi dammo aham pi dammoseems to be an attempt to make sense of an obscure original. The Sinhala translation repeats the Pāli and adds in parenthesesmama de gavayem,mama de gavayem, (\"I too am a cow, I too am a cow\"). DOP relatesamhā2to Skthambhā, \"the lowing of a cow, a cow.\" See SED, svhambhā, \"lowing or bellowing of cattle.\"() But his appearance would not be like that of the cows, (2) his braying would not be like that of the cows, and (3) his footprint would not be like that of the cows. Yet he follows right behind a herd of cattle,thinking: ‘I’m a cow too, I’m a cow too.’",
    "an3.82:2": "\"So too, a bhikkhu might be following right behind the Saṅgha of bhikkhus,thinking: ‘I’m a bhikkhu too, I’m a bhikkhu too.’ (1) But his desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior is not like that of the other bhikkhus; () his desire to undertake the training in the higher mind is not like that of the other bhikkhus; (3) his desire to undertake the training in the higher wisdom is not like that of the other bhikkhus. Yet he follows right behind the Saṅgha of bhikkhus,thinking: ‘I’m a bhikkhu too, I’m a bhikkhu too.’",
    "an3.82:3": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher mind; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher wisdom.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.\""
