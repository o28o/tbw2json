    "an9.8:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the wanderer Sajjha approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:",
    "an9.8:2": "\"Bhante, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rājagaha ….as in 9:7… Bhante, did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One, grasp it correctly, attend to it correctly, remember it correctly?\"",
    "an9.8:3": "\"Yes, Sajjha, you heard that correctly, grasped it correctly, attended to it correctly, remembered it correctly. In the past, Sajjha, and also now I say thus: ‘A bhikkhu who is an arahant—one whose taints are destroyed … one completely liberated through final knowledge—is incapable of transgression in nine cases. (1) He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life; (2) he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given; () he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood; (5) he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman; (6) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of desire; (7) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of hatred; (8) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of delusion; (9) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of fear.’ In the past, Sajjha, and also now I say thus: ‘A bhikkhu who is an arahant—one whose taints are destroyed … one completely liberated through final knowledge—is incapable of transgression in these nine cases.’\""
