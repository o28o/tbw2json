    "an2.17:1": "Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: \"Why is it, Master Gotama, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?\""
