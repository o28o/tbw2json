    "an2.19:1": "\"Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome! It is possible to abandon the unwholesome. If it were not possible to abandon the unwholesome, I would not say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’ But because it is possible to abandon the unwholesome, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’ If this abandoning of the unwholesome led to harm and suffering, I would not tell you to abandon it. But because the abandoning of the unwholesome leads to welfare and happiness, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome!’"
