    "an1.269:1": "\"It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person accomplished in view could consider any conditioned phenomenon as pleasurable; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that a worldling might consider some conditioned phenomenon as pleasurable; there is such a possibility.\"[n.5]Mp:\"This is said with reference to the obsession with pleasure that occurs by way of the view of self(attadiṭṭhivasena), as in those who hold that the self is exclusively blissful and immortal, etc. But, with a mind dissociated from views(diṭṭhivippayuttacittena), a noble disciple afflicted with fever might regard even feces as pleasurable, believing it can allay his fever.\""
