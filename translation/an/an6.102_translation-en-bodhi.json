    "an6.102:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena.[n.445]Sabbasaṅkhāresu anodhiṁ karitvā aniccasaññaṁ upaṭṭhāpetuṁ.Mp:\"Unlimited: without setting a boundary thus: ‘Only these conditioned phenomena, but no others, are impermanent.’\"What six? () ‘All conditioned phenomena will appear to me as unlasting. (2) My mind will not delight in anything in the world. (3) My mind will rise up from the entire world. (4) My mind will slope toward nibbāna. (5) My fetters will be abandoned.[n.446]Ceand Ee havegacchanti, but the future meaning (originally conveyed by this form) seems intended here. Be hasgacchissanti, perhaps a novel future form.And (6) I will come to possess supreme asceticism.’[n.447] I read withBeand Eebhavissāmi, as against Cebhavissati."
