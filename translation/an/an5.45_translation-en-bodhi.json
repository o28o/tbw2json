    "an5.45:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness—heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven—that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.",
    "an5.45:2": "What five? \"(1) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a robethat one has given him, one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness … that leads … to one's welfare and happiness.",
    "an5.45:3": "(2) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using almsfood (that one has given him), one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness … that leads … to one's welfare and happiness.",
    "an5.45:4": "(5) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using medicines and provisions for the sick (that one has given him),one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness … that leads to one's welfare and happiness.",
    "an5.45:5": "\"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to measure his merit thus: ‘Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness—heavenly … that leads to … one's welfare and happiness’; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.",

The omission from Ce must be an editorial oversight, as the thousands of gallons are in the Ce version ofAN4.51.or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,’ but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit … it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.\"",
    "an5.45:7": "Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people,flowing downstream, reach the ocean,the great mass of water, the boundless sea,the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems;",
    "an5.45:8": "so the streams of merit reach the wise manwho is a giver of food, drink, and cloth;(they reach) the donor of beds, seats, and coverslike rivers carrying their waters to the sea."
