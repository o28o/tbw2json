    "an5.220:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers in Madhurā.[n.223] The capital of the state of Surasena, situated on the Yamunā River in northern India. It later became an important center for the Mūlasarvāstivādins. Though the text makes the Buddha say he did not like the place, one wonders whether this sutta might be an interpolation inserted by the Vibhajjavādins to denigrate the headquarters of their rival Buddhist school.What five? It is uneven; it is dusty; its dogs are fierce; it has wild spirits; and it is difficult to gain almsfood there. These are the five dangers in Madhurā.\""
