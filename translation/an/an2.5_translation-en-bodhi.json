    "an2.5:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I have personally known two things: non-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities and indefatigability in striving.[n.22]Mp:\"Bynon-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities(asantuṭṭhitā kusalesu dhammesu)he shows: ‘Not being content merely with jhāna or the luminous mark (of concentration), I aroused the path of arahantship. Until that arose, I was not content. And being dissatisfied in striving, I strove on, standing firm without retreating.’ ‘Indefatigability’(appaṭivānitā)means not turning back, not retreating. ByI strove indefatigably, what is meant is this: ‘When I was a bodhisatta, I strove on, not retreating, aspiring for omniscience.’\"I strove indefatigably,resolved: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.’[n.222] This determination is found elsewhere in the Nikāyas: in AN atAN8:3,MN 50.25, I 48,; and SN2.22.It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage.[n.223]Mp:\"Heedfulness(appamāda)consists in non-separation from mindfulness.Unsurpassed security from bondage(anuttara yogakkhema): by heedfulness he attained not only enlightenment but also unsurpassed security from bondage, consisting in the fruit of arahantship and nibbāna.\""
