    "an1.42:1": "\"Bhikkhus, suppose a well-directed spike of hill rice or barley were pressed by the hand or foot. It is possible that it would pierce the hand or the foot and draw blood. For what reason? Because the spike is well directed. So too, it is possible that a bhikkhu with a well-directed mind would pierce ignorance, arouse true knowledge, and realize nibbƒÅna. For what reason? Because the mind is well directed.\""
