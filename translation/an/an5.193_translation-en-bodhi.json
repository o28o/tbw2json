    "an5.193:2": "(1) \"Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust,[n.119]Mpinterprets the escape from the hindrances by way of the threefold escape. In relation to the hindrance of sensual desire, escape by suppression(vikkhambhananissaraṇa)occurs through the first jhāna based on the unattractive nature of the body, escape in a particular respect(tadaṅganissaraṇa)through insight, and escape by eradication(samucchedanissaraṇa)through the path of arahantship (broadly interpretingkāmacchandaas craving for any object). (ii) The escape fromill willoccurs by suppression through the first jhāna based on loving-kindness, and by eradication through the path of the non-returner. (iii) The escape fromdullness and drowsinessoccurs by suppression through the perception of light (the visualization of a bright light) and by eradication through the path of arahantship. (iv) The escape fromrestlessness and remorseoccurs by suppression through serenity—remorsebeing then eradicated through the path of the non-returner andrestlessnessthrough the path of arahantship. And (v) the escape fromdoubtoccurs by suppression through the defining of phenomena(dhammavavatthāna; see Vism 587–93, Ppn 18.3–4) and by eradication through the path of stream-entry.Mpdoes not apply \"escape in a particular respect\" to the last four hindrances, but Mp-ṭ says it occurs in that the hindrances can be dispelled by reflection(paṭisaṅkhānavasena tassa vinodetabbatāya tadaṅganissaraṇampi labbhat’eva).on that occasion one does not know and see as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both.[n.1193]Mpinterprets these terms from a monastic perspective. One's own good(attattha)is arahantship, and the good of others(parattha)is the welfare of the lay supporters who provide one with material support (because the offering of such gifts creates merit).Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been so recited.
