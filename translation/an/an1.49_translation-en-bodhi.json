    "an1.49:1": "\"Luminous, bhikkhus, is this mind, but it is defiled by adventitious defilements.\"[n.46] AtAN3.02the wordpabhassarais used to describe the mind(citta)that has attained concentration(sam훮dhi). It thus seems that it is in deepsam훮dhithat the intrinsic luminosity of the mind emerges, at least temporarily.AN5.23says explicitly that the mind freed from the five hindrances is luminous(pabhassara)and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. See tooMN, where it is equanimity(upekkh훮), presumably of the fourth jh훮na, that is described as luminous."
