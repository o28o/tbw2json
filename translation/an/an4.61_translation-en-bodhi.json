In Buddhist monastic culture, theupajjhāyais the senior monk who presides over one's ordination. Thus the use of the word here, in a non-monastic context, is unusual.Mpexplains the word in this passage as if it means friends, \"because one's friends should be concerned about one's happiness and suffering(sukhadukkhesu upanijjhāyitabbattā),\" but this explanation depends on an unconvincing word play.Upajjhāyais not connected to the verbupanijjhāyati(Sktupanidhyāyati), \"to think of, to consider,\" but toajjheti(Sktadhyeti), \"to study, to learn from (a teacher).\"This is the second thing … rarely gained in the world.",
