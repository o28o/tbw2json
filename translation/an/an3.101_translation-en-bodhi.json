    "an3.101:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are gross defilements of gold: soil, grit, and gravel. Now the soil remover or his apprentice first pours the gold into a trough and washes, rinses, and cleans it. When that has been removed and eliminated, there still remain middle-size defilements in the gold: fine grit and coarse sand.",
    "an3.101:2": "\"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind, (1) there are in him gross defilements: bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct. An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, () there remain in him middling defilements: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, (3) there remain in him subtle defilements: thoughts about his relations,[n.556] I read withCeand Beñātivitakko, as against Eejātivitakko, \"thoughts about (social) class.\"thoughts about his country, and thoughts about his reputation.[n.557]Anavaññattipaṭisaṁyutto vitakko. Lit. \"thought connected with not being looked down upon.\" The Chinese parallel has \"thought about rebirth in heaven\" ().An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, then there remain thoughts connected with the Dhamma.[n.558]Dhammavitakkā.Mpglosses this as thoughts connected with the ten corruptions of insight(dasa vipassan’upakkilesavitakkā), but it seems this could just as well mean reflections on the teaching or on the meditation subject.That concentration is not peaceful and sublime, not gained by full tranquilization,[n.559]Cereadsna paṭippassaddhiladdhoandpaṭippassaddhiladdhoin the sutta, but Mp Ce hasna paṭippassaddhaladdhoandpaṭippassaddhaladdhoin the respective lemmas. Moreover, inAN5.7(where only the positive term occurs), Ce and Be havepaṭippassaddhaladdho, as against Eepaṭippassaddhiladdho. Mp Ce here readspaṭippassaddhiladdhoin the lemma, as against Mp Bepaṭippassaddhaladdho. Mp says thatpaṭippassaddhaṁandpaṭippassaddhiare one in meaning(idaṁ atthato ekaṁ), proposing two resolutions: \"It is gained by the full tranquilizing of defilements, or it has gained the full tranquilization of defilements(kilesapaṭippassaddhiyā laddhattā kilesapaṭippassaddhibhāvaṁ vā laddhattā), thus it ispaṭippassaddhiladdho.\"not attained to unification, but is reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing (the defilements).[n.560]Ceand Eesasaṅkhāraniggayhavāritavato; in place of–vatoBe reads the termination as–gato. I interpretsasaṅkhāraas \"forceful\" (lit. \"with exertion\");niggayhaas \"having suppressed\";vāritaas \"reined in\"; and (following Ce)–vatoas \"checked.\" A rendering based on the Be variant might be: \"but is reached whenthe defilementsare reined in by forcefully suppressing (them).\"",
