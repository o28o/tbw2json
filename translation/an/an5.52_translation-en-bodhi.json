    "an5.52:1": "\"Bhikkhus, saying ‘a heap of the unwholesome,’ it is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this.[n.045] Also atSN47:5, followed by a declaration that the four establishments of mindfulness are \"a heap of the wholesome\"(kusalarāsī). Here I follow Be and Ee, which do not includeimein the opening. Ce hasimeboth in the opening and at the end; Be does not have it in either place.For the five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. Bhikkhus, saying ‘a heap of the unwholesome,’ it is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For these five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome.\""
