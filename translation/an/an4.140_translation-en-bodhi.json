    "an4.140:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four speakers. What four?() There is the speaker who exhausts the meaning but not the phrasing. (2) There is the speaker who exhausts the phrasing but not the meaning. (3) There is the speaker who exhausts both the meaning and the phrasing. (4) And there is the speaker who does not exhaust either the meaning or the phrasing. These are the four speakers. It is impossible and inconceivable that one who possesses the four analytical knowledges will exhaust either the meaning or the phrasing.\"[n.835] On the four analytical knowledges(paṭisambhidā), see below note 875."
