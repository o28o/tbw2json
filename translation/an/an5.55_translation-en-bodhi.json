    "an5.55:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion a mother and a son, being respectively a bhikkhunī and a bhikkhu, had entered the rains residence at Sāvatthī. They often wanted to see one another, the mother often wanting to see her son, and the son his mother. Because they often saw one another, a bond was formed; because a bond formed, intimacy arose; because there was intimacy, lust found an opening.[n.049]Tesaṁ abhiṇhaṁ dassanā saṁsaggo ahosi, saṁsagge sati vissāso ahosi; vissāse sati otāro ahosi. Though I translatevissāsoas \"intimacy,\" the word does not mean that at this point they had intimate physical relations.Vissāsois, rather, a feeling of trust that can lead to a sexual relationship. For this to occur, however, intimacy must first provide an opening for lust. This is indicated by the expressionotāro ahosi.With their minds in the grip of lust, without having given up the training and declared their weakness, they engaged in sexual intercourse.[n.050] A violation of the firstpārājikaor expulsion offense.",
    "an5.55:2": "Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened.",
    "an5.55:3": "The Blessed One said:\"Bhikkhus, did that foolish man think: ‘A mother does not fall in love with her son, or a son with his mother’? (1) Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other form that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the form of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the form of a woman—ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it[n.1051] I follow the sequence ofBeand Ee, which readgiddhā gathitā mucchitā ajjhopannā, as against Cegathitā giddhā mucchitā ajjhopannā. The sequence—gathita, mucchita, ajjhopanna—is common in the texts.—sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's form.",
    "an5.55:4": "(2) I do not see even one other sound … (3) … even one other odour … () … even one other taste … (5) … even one other touch that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the touch of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the touch of a woman—ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it—sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's touch.",
    "an5.55:5": "\"Bhikkhus, while walking, a woman obsesses the mind of a man; while standing … while sitting … while lying down … while laughing … while speaking … while singing … while crying a woman obsesses the mind of a man. When swollen,[n.102] Be and Eeugghātitā(Ceugghānitā).Mpglosses withuddhumātā, \"bloated,\" a stage in the decomposition of a corpse. Five such stages are mentioned atAN1.480–84. Perhaps the next item, the dead woman, refers to a deceased woman preserved in memory rather than a corpse. Brahmāli suggests takingugghātitāas \"obese,\" but I’m not sure this would work. DOP svugghāṭeti2gives \"puffedup, swollen\" among its meanings.too, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. Even when dead, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anything: ‘Entirely a snare of Māra,’ it is precisely of women that one could say this.\"[n.103] HereCehas merelyyampi taṁ bhikkhave sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso mārassā ti, which is incomplete. Hence I follow Be and Ee:yaṁ hi taṁ bhikkhave sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso mārassā ti mātugāmaṁ yeva sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso mārassā ti.",
    "an5.55:6": "One might talk with a murderous foe,one might talk with an evil spirit,one might even approach a viperwhose bite means certain death;but with a woman, one to one,one should never talk.",
    "an5.55:7": "They bind one whose mind is muddledwith a glance and a smile,with their dress in disarray,and with gentle speech.It is not safe to approach[n.1054]Suvāsīdo: based on the verbāsīdati, to approach, with prefixsuand –v- as a liaison consonant.such a personthough she is swollen and dead.",
    "an5.55:8": "These five objects of sensual pleasureare seen in a woman's body:forms, sounds, tastes, and odours,and also delightful touches.",
    "an5.55:9": "Those swept up by the flood of sensuality,who do not fully understand sense pleasures,are plunged headlong into saṁsāra,intotime,destination, and existence upon existence.[n.1055]Mpglossespurakkhatāwith \"forerunners, those who have gone in front\"(purecārikā purato gatāyeva). My rendering \"are plunged headlong\" is free but captures the sense. Vanarata suggests thatkālaṁ, gatiṁ, andbhavābhavaṁmay be abbreviated locatives or split compound factors to be joined withsaṁsārasmiṁ, but I think the verse may use the accusative for metrical reasons. There is no identified Chinese parallel of this sutta with which to make a comparison.",
    "an5.55:10": "But those who have fully understood sense pleasureslive without fear from any quarter.Having attained the destruction of the taints,while in the world, they have gone beyond."
