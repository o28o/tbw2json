    "an5.293:1": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an Ājīvaka is deposited in hell as if brought there.[n.248] A sect of ascetics contemporary with the Buddha. Makkhali Gosāla is regarded as their founder, or perhaps simply one of their prominent teachers. While the text stipulates conditions for the non-Buddhist ascetics to go to hell, it mentions none that will enable them to be reborn in heaven.What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, does not observe celibacy, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, an Ājīvaka is deposited in hell as if brought there.\""
