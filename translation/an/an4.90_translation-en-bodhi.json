    "an4.90:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The ascetic unshaken, the white-lotus ascetic, the red-lotus ascetic, and the delicate ascetic among ascetics.",
    "an4.90:2": "(1) \"And how, bhikkhus, is a person an ascetic unshaken? Here, a bhikkhu is a trainee who has not attained his mind's ideal, one who dwells aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage. It is in this way that a person is an ascetic unshaken.",
    "an4.90:3": "(2) \"And how is a person a white-lotus ascetic? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging: ‘Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling, such its origin, such its passing away; such is perception, such its origin, such its passing away; such are volitional activities, such their origin, such their passing away; such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away’; yet he does not dwell having contacted with the body the eight emancipations. It is in this way that a person is a white-lotus ascetic.",
    "an4.90:4": "(3) \"And how is a person a red-lotus ascetic? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging: ‘Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling … such is perception … such are volitional activities … such is consciousness, such its origin,such its passing away’; and he dwells having contacted with the body the eight emancipations. It is in this way that a person is a red-lotus ascetic.",
    "an4.90:5": "(4) \"And how is a person a delicate ascetic among ascetics? Here, a bhikkhu usually uses a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to him …as in 4:87… If one could rightly say of anyone: ‘He is a delicate ascetic among ascetics,’ it is precisely of me that one might say this."
