    "an5.206:2": "() \"Again, a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for the body, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it. When a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for the body, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … and striving, this is the second bondage of the mind."
