    "an1.63:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing that so causes unarisen wholesome qualities to arise and arisen unwholesome qualities to decline as fewness of desires.[n.53]Appicchatā.Mp:\"Whereas the expression (‘fewness of desires’) might be taken to mean that there could be a residue (of desire), the meaning is that there isno residue. For one is not called ‘of few desires’ if one still has slight desire; it is through the absence of desire, through persistent greedlessness, that one is said to be of few desires.\"For one with few desires, unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline.\""
