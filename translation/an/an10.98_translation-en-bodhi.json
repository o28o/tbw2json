    "an10.98:1": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he lives. What ten? () An elder is of long-standing, long gone forth. (2) He is virtuous …. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (3) He has learned much … and penetrated well by view. (4) Both Pāṭimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (5) He is skilled in the origination and settlement of disciplinary issues. (6) He loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. (7) He is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. (8) He is graceful when going forward and returning, and also well restrained when sitting among the houses. (9) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (0) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he lives.\""
