    "an2.21:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of fools. What two? One who does not see his transgression as a transgression and one who does not, in accordance with the Dhamma, accept the transgression of one who is confessing. These are the two kinds of fools.[n.240] Also atSN:24, where it is embedded in a story and embellished with a verse."
