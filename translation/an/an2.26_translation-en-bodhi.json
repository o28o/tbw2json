    "an2.26:1": "\"Bhikkhus, for one with concealed actions one of two destinations is to be expected: hell or the animal realm.[n.244]Mpinterprets \"concealed action\"(paṭicchannakamma)simply as a bad deed, explaining that even if a bad deed is not concealed, it is still called a concealed action. However, it seems that confessing one's bad deed and making amends for it would mitigate its negative force. SeeDhp 73: \"One who has committed a bad deed but covers it up with good illumines this world like the moon freed from a cloud.\""
