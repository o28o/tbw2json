    "an8.90:1": "\"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu charged with aggravated misconduct[n.83]Tassapāpiyasikakamma. The grounds for this penalty are discussed at Vin II 85–86. See, too, Ṭhānissaro 2007a: 549–5, where it is rendered \"further-punishment transaction.\" According to the origin story, this penalty is imposed on a bhikkhu who speaks evasively or reacts aggressively when charged with a grave offense (an offense of thesaṅghādisesaclass) and then admits to it only under pressure.should behave rightly with respect to eight principles.
