    "an1.268:1": "\"It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person accomplished in view could consider any conditioned phenomenon as permanent; there is no such possibility. But it is possiblethat a worldling might consider some conditioned phenomenon as permanent; there is such a possibility.\"[n.50]Mp:\"One accomplished in view(diṭṭhisampanna)is a noble disciple, a stream-enterer, possessing the view of the path(maggadiṭṭhiyā sampanna). The worldling, in contrast, can consider the conditioned phenomena of the three planes (the sensory plane, the form plane, and the formless plane) as permanent by way of the eternalist view(sassatadiṭṭhi).\""
