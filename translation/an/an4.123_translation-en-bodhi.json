    "an4.123:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?",
    "an4.123:2": "() \"Again, some person, with the subsiding of thought and examination, enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of streaming radiance. The life span of the devas of streaming radiance is two eons.[n.81] The devas of streaming radiance(devā ābhassarā)are the highest class of devas associated with the second jhāna.Mp:\"Thesecond jhāna is threefold, as stated above (for the first jhāna). For those reborn by a superior grade, the life span is eight eons; by a middling grade, four eons; and by an inferior grade, two eons. The text refers to the last.\"The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth.",
    "an4.123:3": "() \"Again, some person, with the fading away as well of rapture, dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of refulgent glory. The life span of the devas of refulgent glory is four eons.[n.81] The devas of refulgent glory(devā subhakiṇhā)are the highest class of devas associated with the third jhāna. According to the Abhidhamma system, the life spans of the three planes corresponding to the third jhāna are respectively sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four eons. Since this is contradicted by the sutta,Mpexplains that what is intended here is the lowest plane among those planes reached by rebirth through attainment of the third jhāna. However, according toMp,the devas of refulgent glory are actually the highest among these realms, with a life span of sixty-four eons. There thus seems to be a contradiction between the sutta and the systematic Theravāda determination of life spans.The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth.",
    "an4.123:4": "() \"Again, some person, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it.If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of great fruit. The life span of the devas of great fruit is five hundred eons.[n.81] These are thedevā vehapphalā, the sole realm of rebirth corresponding to the mundane fourth jhāna. This figure is in agreement with the stipulation of the Abhidhamma.The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth."
