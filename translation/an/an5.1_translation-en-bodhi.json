    "an5.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "an5.1:2": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers.[n.974]Pañca sekhabalāni. Despite a partial overlap, these should not be confused with the five powers(pañca balāni)included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, which are introduced atAN5.13–16.Mp:\"Trainee's powers: the powers of the seven trainees. The power of faith is so called because it does not waver(na kampati)in the face of faithlessness; the power of moral shame does not waver in the face of moral shamelessness; the power of moral dread does not waver in the face of moral recklessness; the power of energy does not waver in the face of laziness; and the power of wisdom does not waver in the face of ignorance.\"What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers.",
    "an5.1:3": "Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of energy, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.\"This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement.[n.975] InBeonly."
