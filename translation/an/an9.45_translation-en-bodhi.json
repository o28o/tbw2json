    "an9.45:2": "(1) \"Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna …. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever wayit is attained, and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated in both respects in a provisional sense.",
    "an9.45:3": "(9) \"Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. He dwells having contacted that base with the body in whatever wayit is attained, and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent, friend, the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated in both respects in a non-provisional sense.\""
