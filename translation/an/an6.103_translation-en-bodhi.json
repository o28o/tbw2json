    "an6.103:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu considers six benefits, it is enough for him to establish the unlimited perception of suffering in all conditioned phenomena. What six? () ‘The perception of disenchantment will be established in me toward all conditioned phenomena, as toward a murderer with uplifted dagger. (2) My mind will rise up from the entire world. (3) I will see nibbāna as peaceful. (4) My underlying tendencies will be uprooted. (5) I will be one who has done his task. And (6) I will have served the Teacher with loving-kindness.’"
