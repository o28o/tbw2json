    "an4.132:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One whose discernment is incisive but not free-flowing;[n.830]Yuttappaṭibhāno no muttappaṭibhāno.Mp:\"When answering a question, he answers correctly(yuttameva), but he does not answer quickly(sīghaṁ pana na katheti). The meaning is that he answers slowly. This method (of explanation) should be applied to all the cases.\" Pp 42 (Be §52) defines this person in the same sense thus: \"A person who, being asked a question, speaks correctly but not quickly is called one whose discernment is incisive but not free-flowing\"(idh’ekacco puggalo pañhaṁ puṭṭho samāno yuttaṁ vadati no sīghaṁ, ayaṁ vuccati puggalo yuttappaṭibhāno no muttappaṭibhāno).one whose discernment is free-flowing but not incisive; one whose discernment is both incisive and free-flowing; and one whose discernment is neither incisive nor free-flowing. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.\""
