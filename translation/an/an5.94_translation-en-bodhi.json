    "an5.94:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of dwelling at ease. What five? () Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … (2) … the second jhāna … (3) … the third jhāna … (4) … the fourth jhāna. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. These are the five kinds of dwelling at ease.\""
