    "an5.12:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers. Among these five trainee's powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them.",
    "an5.12:2": "Just as the peak is the chief part of a peaked-roof house, the part that holds all the others in place, that unifies them, so among these five trainee powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them.",
    "an5.12:3": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: (1) ‘We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; (2) the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; () the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; (4) the power of energy, a trainee's power; (5) the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.\""
