    "an5.122:2": "What are the five? Here, a bhikkhu has mindfulness well established internally forgainingthe wisdom that discerns the arising and passing away of phenomena;[n.115] I follow the punctuation ofBeand Ee, which connectdhammānaṁ udayatthagāminiyā paññāyawith the precedingajjhattaṁ yeva sati sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. Ce puts a comma afterhotiand no punctuation afterpaññāya, thus connectingdhammānaṁ udayatthagāminiyā paññāyawith the followingasubhānupassī kāye viharati. This, however, connects the meditation on the body's unattractive nature with the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, a connection that, to my knowledge, is not made elsewhere in the Nikāyas (apart from the repetitive refrain in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta).he dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, and contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena. If any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates these five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.\""
