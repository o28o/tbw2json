    "an1.62:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing that so causes unarisen unwholesome qualities to arise and arisen wholesome qualities to decline as strong desire.[n.52]Mahicchatā.Mpexplains this as \"strong greed\"(mahālobho)and, for a formal definition, it quotes Vibh 35 (Be §850): \"What is strong desire? Lack of contentment, excessive desire with regard to robes, almsfood, dwelling places, medicines, and the five objects of sensual pleasure. Such desire, desirousness, strong desire, lust, passion, mental passion, is called strong desire.\"For one with strong desire, unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline.\""
