    "an1.576-582:1": "Bhikkhus, one thing, when developed and cultivated, (576) leads to a strong sense of urgency[n.206]Saṁvejaniyesu ṭhānesu saṁvijjanti. On a sense of urgency(saṁvega), seeAN3.28,AN4.3. The commentaries enumerate \"eight bases of the sense of urgency\"(aṭṭha saṁvegavatthūni): birth, old age, illness, death; the suffering in the realms of misery; the suffering rooted in one's saṁsāric past; the suffering to be encountered in one's saṁsāric future; and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment.… (577) leads to great good … (578) leads to great security from bondage … (579) leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension … (580) leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision … (58) leads to a pleasant dwelling in this very life … (582) leads to realization of the fruit of knowledge and liberation. What is that one thing? Mindfulness directed to the body. This is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, leads to realization of the fruit of knowledge and liberation.\""
