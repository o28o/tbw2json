    "an3.136:1": "() \"Bhikkhus, whether Tathāgatas arise or not, there persists that law, that stableness of the Dhamma, that fixed course of the Dhamma:[n.60]Ṭhitā sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā.Mpoffers only an unhelpful word gloss based on the identification of adhammawith a thing that bears a real nature(sabhāva):Dhammaṭṭhitatāti sabhāvaṭṭhitatā.Dhammaniyāmatāti sabhāvaniyāmatā.‘All conditioned phenomena are impermanent.’ A Tathāgata awakens to this and breaks through to it, and then he explains it, teaches it, proclaims it, establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it, and elucidates it thus: ‘All conditioned phenomena are impermanent.’[n.602]Mpexplains impermanent(anicca)here as non-existent after having come to be(hutvā abhāvaṭṭhena); suffering(dukkha)as oppression(sampīḷanaṭṭhena dukkhā); and non-self(anattā)as not subject to the exercise of mastery(avasavattanaṭṭhena). In SN2:20, II 25–27, this same framework is applied to the twelvefold formula of dependent origination."
