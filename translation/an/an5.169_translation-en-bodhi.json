I follow the sequence ofCe.Be and Ee putbyañjanakusalobeforeniruttikusalo. As stated, the first three terms obviously correspond to the first threepaṭisambhidāknowledges. Perhaps the last two can be comprised underpaṭibhānapaṭisambhidā.Mpexplains five types of sequence: sequence of meaning(atthapubbāpara), sequence of Dhamma(dhammapubbāpara), sequence of syllables(akkharapubbāpara), sequence of phrasing(byañjanapubbāpara), and sequence of sections within a sutta(anusandhipubbāpara).In this way, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is one of quick apprehension concerning wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned.\""
