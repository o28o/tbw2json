    "an1.317:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings. Who is that one person? It is one who holds right view and has a correct perspective. He draws many people away from a bad Dhamma and establishes them in the good Dhamma. This is that one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.\"[n.74]Mp:\"When a Buddha has not arisen, this is a bodhisatta in the role of a wheel-turning monarch and others who are similar. When a Buddha has arisen, it is a Buddha and his disciples.\""
