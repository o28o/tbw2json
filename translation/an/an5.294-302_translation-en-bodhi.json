I am uncertain which of these terms designate a specific religious school and which designate only a mode of practice. Hence I use initial capitals only for those that are known to designate religious schools contemporary with the Buddha.What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, does not observe celibacy, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, adevadhammikais deposited in hell as if brought there.\""
