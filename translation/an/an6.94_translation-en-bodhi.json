One accomplished in view is () incapable of depriving his mother of life; (2) incapable of depriving his father of life; (3) incapable of depriving an arahant of life; (3) incapable of shedding the Tathāgata's blood with a mind of hatred; (5) incapable of creating a schism in the Saṅgha; (6) incapable of acknowledging another teacher.[n.443]Aññaṁ satthāraṁ uddisituṁ. That is, of looking to someone else apart from the Buddha as one's ultimate spiritual teacher.These are the six cases of incapability.\""
