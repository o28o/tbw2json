    "an4.16:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness.[n.645]Mp:\"Kinds of exquisiteness[or fineness, delicacy, subtlety]: knowledges that penetrate subtle characteristics\"(sokhummānīti sukhumalakkhaṇapativijjhanakāni ñāṇāni). The nounsokhumma, from the common adjectivesukhuma, is rare and in the Nikāyas appears to occur only here and in a compound atTh 437. Mp's explanation seems to me problematic. I would identify exquisiteness of form with the form perceived in the fourth jhāna, exquisiteness of feeling with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling occurring in the fourth jhāna and the formless attainments, exquisiteness of perception with the perception in the base of nothingness, and exquisiteness of volitional activities with the residual volitional activities in the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception.What four? () Here, a bhikkhu possesses supreme exquisiteness of form. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one. (2) He possesses supreme exquisiteness of feeling… (3) … supreme exquisiteness of perception … (4) … supreme exquisiteness of volitional activities. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one.",
    "an4.16:2": "Having known the exquisiteness of form,the origination of feelings,how perception arises,and where it disappears;having known volitional activitiesas alien, as suffering, and not as self,",
    "an4.16:3": "truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly,[n.646] I read withCeand Besa ve sammaddaso bhikkhu. Ee'ssaceforsa veis clearly a mistake.peaceful, delights in the peaceful state.He bears his final body,having conquered Māra and his mount."
