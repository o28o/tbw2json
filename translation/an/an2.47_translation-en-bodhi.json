    "an2.47:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. What two? The assembly trained in vain talk, not in interrogation, and the assembly trained in interrogation, not in vain talk.[n.284] For the meaning ofukkācitaI followDOP, p. 387, which defines it as \"boasting, empty talk,\" andukkācitavinītaas \"trained in empty talk.\" I use \"vain talk\" rather than \"empty talk,\" since the talk considered worthy here is precisely talk about emptiness. Vibh 352 (Be §862) includesukkācanāin a definition oflapanā, which suggests thatukkācanāis a tool of persuasion. See too Vism 27,9 — 22, Ppn .74. In the present suttaukkācitaseems to have a different nuance, perhaps elegant but hollow talk."
