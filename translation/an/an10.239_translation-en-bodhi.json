    "an10.239:1": "\"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, ten things are to be developed. What ten? Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation. For direct knowledge of lust, these ten things are to be developed.\"[n.297] It seems peculiar for right knowledge and right liberation to be treated as conditions for direct knowledge, for (as denoting the knowledge and liberation of the arahant) they are normally themselves the results of direct knowledge."
