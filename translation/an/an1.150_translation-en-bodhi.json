    "an1.150:1": "\"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain what is not an offense as an offense are acting for the harm of many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. These bhikkhus generate much demerit and cause this good Dhamma to disappear.\""
