    "an1.55:1": "\"Bhikkhus, if for just the time of a finger snap a bhikkhu attends to a mind of loving-kindness, he is called a bhikkhu who is not devoid of jhƒÅna, who acts upon the teaching of the Teacher, who responds to his advice, and who does not eat the country's almsfood in vain. How much more, then, those who cultivate it!\""
