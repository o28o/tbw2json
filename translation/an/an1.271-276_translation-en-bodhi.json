    "an1.271-276:1": "(27) \"It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person accomplished in view could deprive his mother of life … (272) that a person accomplished in view could deprive his father of life … (273) that a person accomplished in view could deprive an arahant of life … (274) that a person accomplished in view could, with a mind of hatred, shed the blood of the Tathāgatha … (275) that a person accomplished in view could create a schism in the Saṅgha … (276) that a person accomplished in view could acknowledge someone otherthan the Buddhaas teacher; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that a worldling could acknowledge someone otherthan the Buddhaas teacher; there is such a possibility.\"[n.53] The first five are the heinous deeds that bring immediate result(ānantariya kamma), necessarily producing rebirth in hell in the next existence. The five are mentioned collectively inAN6.94. The six items together are referred to atSn 233as \"the six things that cannot be done\"(cha cābhiṭhānāni abhabbo kātuṁ)by the stream-enterer.Mp:\"This here is the intention: ‘The condition of a worldling is blameworthy insofar as a worldling can do these deeds that bring immediate results, such as matricide and so forth. But the noble disciple is powerful since he does not do such deeds.’\" Regarding the shedding of a Tathāgata's blood,Mpsays that the expression \"with a mind of hatred\"(paduṭṭhacitto)is used to highlight the motive. Devadatta, who wanted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Saṅgha, wounded the Buddha in a failed assassination attempt and thereby committed anānantariya kamma. But the physician Jīvaka, wishing to restore the Buddha’s health, cut his skin to extract bad blood; he thereby did a meritorious deed. On schism in the Saṅgha(saṅghabheda), seeAN0.37,AN0.39."
