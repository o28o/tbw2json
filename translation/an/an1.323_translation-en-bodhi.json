    "an1.323:1": "\"Bhikkhus, with a well-expounded Dhamma and discipline, moderation should be known by the recipientof a gift, not by the giver.[n.78]Paṭiggāhakena mattā jānitabbā.Mp:\"The person receiving should set the limit. How? By taking into account the donor, the item to be given, and one's own capacity. For if the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a little, out of consideration for the donor one should accept a little. If there is only a little to be given, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for the item to be given one should accept a little. If the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for one's own capacity one should accept moderately. Having thus known moderation, the recipient fulfills the practice of fewness of wishes. (In this way) those who did not get a share get one, and the gains acquired remain stable. Those without confidence acquire confidence; those with confidence increase in confidence; one becomes an example for the multitude; and one helps the Teaching to continue for a long time.\"For what reason? Because that Dhamma is well expounded.\""
