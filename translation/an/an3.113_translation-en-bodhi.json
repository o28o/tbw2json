    "an3.113:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are three who, if they do not abandon thisfault of theirs, are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell. Which three?() One who, though not celibate, claims to be celibate; (2) one who slanders a pure celibate leading a pure celibate life with a groundless charge of non-celibacy; and (3) one who holds such a doctrine and view as this: ‘There is no fault in sensual pleasures,’ and then falls into indulgence in sensual pleasures.[n.579]So kāmesu pātavyataṁ āpajjati(Be addstāyabeforekāmesu, probably representingtāya diṭṭhiyā).Mp:\"Indulgence: (the view that) they are to be drunk, to be enjoyed; (he thinks they are) to be enjoyed with a mind without hesitation, just as water is to be drunk by one who is thirsty\"(pivitabbataṁ paribhuñjitabbataṁ nirāsaṅkena cittena pipāsitassa pānīyapivanasadisaṁ paribhuñjitabbataṁ). Ps II 37,22–24, commenting onpātabyataṁ āpajjantiat MN I 305,2,says: \"He falls into (the view that) one should drink up sensual objects with the defilement of sensuality, that they are to be enjoyed according to one's pleasure\"(te vatthukāmesu kilesakāmena pātabyataṁ pivitabbataṁ, yathāruci paribhuñjitabbataṁ āpajjantī ti attho).Pātabba(=pātavya)occurs as an optative participle ofpivati, to drink, at Vin II 208,.MN 45.2, I 305, ascribes this view to \"ascetics and brahmins\" who \"consort with women wanderers wearing their hair in a topknot.\"These are the three who, if they do not abandon thisfault of theirs, are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell.\""
