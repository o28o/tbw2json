He speaks falsely; he speaks divisively; he speaks harshly; he speaks idle chatter; with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. These are the five dangers for a person who speaks much.",

He does not speak falsely; he does not speak divisively; he does not speak harshly; he does not speak idle chatter; with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits for a person of judicious speech.\""
