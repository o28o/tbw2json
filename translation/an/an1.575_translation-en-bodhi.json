    "an1.575:1": "\"Bhikkhus, even as one who encompasses with his mind the great ocean includes thereby all the streams that run into the ocean, just so, whoever develops and cultivates mindfulness directed to the body includes all wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge.\"[n.205]Mp:\"Wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge(kusalā dhammā ye keci vijjābhāgiyā): There are eight kinds of true knowledge: insight knowledge, the mind-made body, and the six kinds of direct knowledge (see, e.g.,AN3.0,AN6.2). The qualities associated with these eight are the things that pertain to true knowledge. Or, if one of the eight is taken to be true knowledge, the others are ‘qualities that pertain to true knowledge.’\" AtAN2.3,samathaandvipassanāare said to be the two things that pertain to true knowledge."
