    "an10.55:1": "There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: \"Friends, bhikkhus!\"",
    "an10.55:2": "\"Friends, it is said: ‘A person subject to decline, a person subject to decline.’ In what way has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline, and in what way that a person is not subject to decline?\"",
    "an10.55:3": "\"Well then, friends, listen and attend closely. I will speak.\"",
    "an10.55:4": "\"In what way, friends, has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline? Here, a bhikkhu does not get to hear a teaching he has not heard before, forgets those teachings he has already heard, does not bring to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and does not understand what he has not understood. It is in this way that the Blessed One has said a person is subject to decline.[n.2065] A similar passage is atAN6.51. In the present sutta,Beand Ee read the second item assammosaṁ gacchanti, lit. \"go to forgetting,\" which seems preferable to Cesammohaṁ gacchanti, \"go to delusion.\" InAN6.51all three editions readna sammosaṁ gacchanti, which is supported by Mp's gloss:vināsaṁ na gacchanti(\"they are not lost\"). Here and below, where Ce and Ee readpubbe cetaso samphuṭṭhapubbā, Be has the negativepubbe cetaso asamphuṭṭhapubbā, \"with which he had previously not been familiar.\" This is likely to be a typographical error; atAN6.51Be reads, in conformity with Ce and Ee,pubbe cetaso samphuṭṭhapubbā.",

Here, a bhikkhu gets to hear a teaching he has not heard before, does not forget those teachings he has already heard, brings to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and understands what he has not understood. It is in this way that the Blessed One has said a person is not subject to decline.",
    "an10.55:6": "\"Friends, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others’ mindsshould train: ‘I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.",
    "an10.55:7": "\"And how, friends, is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man—young, youthful, and fond of ornaments—would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean and bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it;and their wish fulfilled, they will think, ‘How fortunate for me that I’m clean!’ So too, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhuto growin wholesome qualities.",
    "an10.55:8": "\"If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu does not see any of these wholesome qualities present in himself, then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguishthe fire onhis clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities.",
    "an10.55:9": "\"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees some wholesome qualities present in himself but not others,he should base himself on those wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire … to extinguishthe fire onhis clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should base himself on the wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire … to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself.",
    "an10.55:10": "\"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees all these wholesome qualities present in himself, he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.\""
