For myself I see a pleasant dwelling in this very lifeand I have compassion for later generations.[n.248]Pacchimañca janataṁ anukampamāno. Ps I 29,4–2, commenting on the same expression at MN I 23,35, says: \"How does he show compassion for later generations by dwelling in the forest? When young men who have gone forth out of faith see that even the Blessed One—who had nothing more to understand, abandon, develop, and realize—did not neglect dwelling in the forest, they will think that they, too, should dwell in the forest. Thus they will quickly make an end of suffering.\"Seeing these two advantages, I resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves.\""
