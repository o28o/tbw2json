    "an4.22:1": "\"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvelā, by the goatherds’ banyan tree on the bank of the Neranjarā River, just after I had attained full enlightenment. Then a number of brahmins, old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, approached me and exchanged greetings with me. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to me:",
    "an4.22:2": "\"It then occurred to me: These venerable ones do not know what an elder is or what the qualities that make one an elder are. Even though someone is old—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years from birth—if he speaks at an improper time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline, if at an improper time he speaks words that are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial, then he is reckoned as a foolishchildishelder.",
    "an4.22:3": "\"But even though someone is young, a youth with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, if he speaks at a proper time, speaks what is truthful, speaks what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline, and if at a proper time he speaks words that are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial, then he is reckoned as a wise elder.",
    "an4.22:4": "\"There are, bhikkhus, these four qualities that make one an elder. What four.",
    "an4.22:5": "The dullard with a restless mind[n.62] I followCein taking the poem to consist of three stanzas of six pādas each. Be divides it into four stanzas, the first with six pādas, the other three with four pādas.who speaks much chatter,his thoughts unsettled,delighting in a bad teaching,holding bad views, disrespectful,is far from an elder's stature.",
    "an4.22:6": "But one accomplished in virtue,learned and discerning,self-controlled in the factors of firmness,who clearly sees the meaning with wisdom;",
    "an4.22:7": "gone beyond all phenomena,not barren, discerning;[n.653] In pāda c, I read with Cesaññato thiradhammesu, as against Be and Eesaññato dhīro dhammesu, \"self-controlled and steadfast among phenomena.\" In this, I follow Vanarata's suggestionin a personal communicationthat the Ce reading \"has the merit of both fitting the meter better and supplying a pun (betweenthiraandthera, firm and elder).\" This clause corresponds to the jhānas, \"factors of firmness\" referring tosamādhi.Mpglosses \"who clearly sees the meaning with wisdom\"(paññāyatthaṁ vipassati)as seeing the meaning of the four noble truths with the wisdom of the path along with insight. It explains \"gone beyond all phenomena\"(pāragū sabbadhammānaṁ)as \"gone beyond all such phenomena as the five aggregates\" and \"gone to the consummation of allgoodqualities\" by the sixfold going beyond(chabbidhena pāragamanena): with respect to direct knowledge, full understanding, abandoning, development, realization, and meditative attainments.Mpdoes not explain the repetition ofpaṭibhānavā\"discerning\"in the verse, which seems peculiar.who has abandoned birth and death,consummate in the spiritual life,",
    "an4.22:8": "in whom there are no taints—he is the one I call an elder.With the destruction of the taintsa bhikkhu is called an elder."
