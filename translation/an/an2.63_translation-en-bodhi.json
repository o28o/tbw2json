    "an2.63:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when, in regard to a disciplinary issue, the exchange of words between both parties,[n.297]Ubhato vacīsaṁsāro. The expression is unusual.Mpexplains that on both sides the talk continues(saṁsaramānā)as they verbally attack one another.the insolence about views, and the resentment, bitterness, and exasperationare not settled internally,[n.298]Cereads hereajjhattaṁ na avūpasantaṁ hoti, \"not unsettled internally,\" which means in effect that the disturbance is settled; that is precisely the opposite of what the context requires. Older Sinhala-script editions, referred to in the notes to Ce, readajjhattaṁ na suvūpasantaṁ hoti, \"not well settled internally,\" which makes better sense. Be and Ee readajjhattaṁ avūpasantaṁ hoti, supported by the lemma ofMp(Ce and Be). I thus translate on the basis of this reading. Similarly, in the following paragraph, Ce readsajjhattaṁ avūpasantaṁ hoti, again the opposite of what the context requires. I take as the basis for my rendering there Be and Eeajjhattaṁ na suvūpasantaṁ hoti.it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time, and the bhikkhus will not dwell at ease."
