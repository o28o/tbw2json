    "an1.3:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other odour that so obsesses the mind of a man as the odour of a woman. The odour of a woman obsesses the mind of a man.\"[n.8]Mp:“The bodily odor of a woman is foul(duggandha), but what is intended here is the odor that comes from her body due to ointments, etc.”"
