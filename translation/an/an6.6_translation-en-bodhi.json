    "an6.6:1": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What six? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odours, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and it is endowed with strength. Possessing these six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.",
