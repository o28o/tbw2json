    "an5.181:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of forest dwellers. What five? () One who becomes a forest dweller because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who becomes a forest dweller because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire;[n.79]Pāpiccho icchāpakato āraññiko hoti.Mp:\"He thinks, ‘While I am living in the forest, they will honor me with the four requisites, thinking I’m a forest dweller. They will esteem me for my virtues, thinking that I’m conscientious and secluded, and so forth.’ Thus he is a forest dweller based on evil desire, because he is overcome by desire.\"(3) one who becomes a forest dweller because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who becomes a forest dweller,thinking: ‘It is praised by the Buddhas and the Buddhas’ disciples’; (5) and one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminatingdefilements, for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five kinds of forest dwellers. One who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminatingdefilements, for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers.",
    "an5.181:2": "\"Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires … for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers.\""
