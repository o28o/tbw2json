    "an4.277-303:1": "\"Bhikkhus, for full understanding of lust … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning …… for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … For the relinquishment of lust, these four things are to be developed.\"[n.973] As the three fourfold practices are to be developed for direct knowledge of lust, so they are to be developed for each of the other nine purposes. Thus there are a total of thirty suttas with respect to lust."
