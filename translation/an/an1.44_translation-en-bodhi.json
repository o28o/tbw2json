    "an1.44:1": "\"Here, bhikkhus, having encompassed a mentally placid person's mind with my own mind, I understand that ifthis person were to die at this time, he would be deposited in heaven as if brought there. For what reason? Because his mind is placid.[n.42]Mp:\"(A mind) placid with faith and confidence\"(saddhāpasādena pasannaṁ).It is because of mental placidity that with the breakup of the body, after death, some beings here are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.\""
