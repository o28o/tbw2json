    "an3.43:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when one sees three advantages, it is enough to teach others the Dhamma. What three? () The one who teaches the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma.[n.403]Mpexplains \"experiences the meaning\"(atthapaṭisaṁvedī)as \"experiences with knowledge the explanation of the meaning (or commentary)\"(aṭṭhakathaṁ ñāṇena paṭisaṁvedī)and \"experiences the Dhamma\"(dhammapaṭisaṁvedī)as \"experiences the Dhamma of the canonical text\"(pāḷidhammaṁ paṭisaṁvedī). This obviously imposes a later distinction on older terms. However, while the two terms are often paired, the precise distinction betweenatthaanddhammais not clearly drawn in the Nikāyas. In fact, each term is ambivalent and thus their different nuances further complicate their relationship.Atthacan signify meaning, benefit, good, and goal;dhammacan signify the teaching, the system of practice, the nature of things, and the truth pointed to by the teaching. Thus the contrast betweendhammaandatthacan be seen as that between the formulated teaching and its meaning, between the practice and its goal, and between the teaching and the benefit it brings.(2) The one who hears the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma. (3) Both the one who teaches the Dhamma and the one who hears the Dhamma experience the meaning and the Dhamma. Seeing these three advantages, it is enough to teach others the Dhamma.\""
