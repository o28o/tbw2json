    "an3.142:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses and the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons. Listen …",
    "an3.142:2": "\"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses? Here, one kind of excellent thoroughbred horse … possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses.",
    "an3.142:3": "\"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons? Here, one kind of person … possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.",
    "an3.142:4": "\"And how does an excellent thoroughbred person … possess speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. And he gains robes … and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way an excellent thoroughbred person possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions."
