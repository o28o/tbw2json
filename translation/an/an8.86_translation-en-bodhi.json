    "an8.86:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānaṅgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: \"It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is now dwellingin the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus:‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened …as in 6:42… he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.\"",
    "an8.86:2": "Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānaṅgala took abundant food of various kinds and went to the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an uproar and a racket. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One's attendant. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Nāgita: \"Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish.\"",
    "an8.86:3": "\"Let the Blessed One now consent, Bhante, let the Fortunate One consent. This is now the time for the Blessed One to consent. Wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and countryside will incline in the same direction. Just as,when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water flows down along the slope, so too, wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and country will incline in the same direction. For what reason? Because of the Blessed One's virtuous behavior and wisdom.\"",
    "an8.86:4": "\"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation … might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise.",
    "an8.86:5": "\"Even some deities, Nāgita, may not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty.",
    "an8.86:6": "(2) \"I see, Nāgita, bhikkhus laughing and playing by poking one another with the fingers. It then occurs to me: ‘Surely, these venerable ones do not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation … which I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty; for these venerable ones laugh and play by poking one another with the fingers.’",
    "an8.86:7": "(3) \"I see, Nāgita, bhikkhus who, having eaten as much as they want until their bellies are full, yield to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep. It then occurs to me: ‘Surely, these venerable ones do not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation … which I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty. For having eaten as much as they want until their bellies are full, they yield to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep.’",
    "an8.86:8": "(4) \"I see, Nāgita, a bhikkhu dwelling on the outskirts of a village sitting in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: ‘Now a monastery attendant or a novice will return to this venerable one and cause him to fall away from that concentration.’[n.10] TheCereading here agrees more closely with the Be reading ofAN6.42than with the Ce reading of the latter. But here Ce has the verbpaccessati, \"to return\" (absent in CeAN6.42), whereas in both suttas Be hasupaṭṭhahissati, \"will serve.\" Ee'ssaccessatiis likely to be a misreading ofpaccessati. This version has no mention ofsahadhammika, a co-religionist, as inAN6.42.For this reason I am not pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling on the outskirts of a village.",
    "an8.86:11": "(5) \"I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting dozing in the forest. It then occurs to me: ‘Now this venerable one will dispel this sleepiness and fatigue and attend only to the perception of forest,a state ofoneness.’ For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.",
    "an8.86:12": "(6) \"I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the forest in an unconcentrated state. It then occurs to me: ‘Now this venerable one will concentrate his unconcentrated mind or guard his concentrated mind.’ For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.",
    "an8.86:13": "(7) \"I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the forest in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: ‘Now this venerable one will liberate his unliberated mind or guard his liberated mind.’ For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.",
    "an8.86:14": "(8) \"When, Nāgita, I am traveling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind me, even if it is just for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion I am at ease.\""
