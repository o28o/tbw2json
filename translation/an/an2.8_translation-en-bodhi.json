    "an2.8:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two bright qualities. What two? Moral shame and moral dread.[n.225] Moral shame(hiri)is disgust at bodily and verbal misconduct; moral dread(ottappa)is moral dread over such misconduct. Moral shame is directed inwardly. It arises from self-respect and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on the sense of one's own inherent dignity. Moral dread has an outward direction. It arises from fear of blame and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on fear of the consequences. For more details, see CMA 86, As 24–25, and Vism 464,3–465,4, Ppn 4.42.These are the two bright qualities.\""
