Others expect endearing speech, so they should be addressed with pleasant words.Beneficent conductis a talk on increasing goodness; these people should be told, ‘You should do this, you shouldn’t do that. You should associate with this person, not with that person.’Impartialityis being the same in happiness and suffering.
