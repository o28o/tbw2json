    "an2.22:1": "\"Bhikkhus, these two misrepresent the Tathāgata. Which two? One full of hate who harbors hatred and one endowed with faith because of his misunderstanding. These two misrepresent the Tathāgata.\"[n.24]Mp:\"The former is exemplified by Sunakkhatta, who said: ‘The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman qualities’ (atMN 2.2, I 68,9–0). The latter is exemplified by a devotee whose faith is destitute of understanding, such as one who misrepresents the Tathāgata by claiming: ‘The Buddha is entirely world-transcending(buddho nāma sabbalokuttaro); all the parts of his body, such as the head hairs, are world-transcending.’\" This latter comment seems to be a dig at the Lokottaravādins, a sub-sect of the Mahāsāṁghikas that held the Buddhas to be entirely world-transcendent."
