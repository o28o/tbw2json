    "an2.87:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two things. What two? Liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom. These are the two things.\"[n.309]Mp:\"Liberation of mind(cetovimutti)is the concentration of the fruit (of arahantship),liberation by wisdom(paññāvimutti)is the wisdom of the fruit.\" This interpretation assumes that the two are conjoined, as in the expressionanāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ. It is possible, however, for mundanecetovimuttito be attained independently ofpaññāvimutti. For a discussion of the contrast between mundane and world-transcending types ofcetovimutti, seeMN 43.30–37, I 297–98, andSN 4.7, IV 295–97."
