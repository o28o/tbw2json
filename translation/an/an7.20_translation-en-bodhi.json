    "an7.20:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these seven bases for (being) ‘ten-less.’[n.472] Here isMp:\"The question (‘How is one tenless?’) is said to have arisen among the outside sectarians. For they call a Nigaṇṭha (a Jain ascetic)niddaso(\"ten-less\") who has died at the time he is ten years of age [dasavassakāle; or: \"at the time he has ten years’ seniority\" (as an ascetic)?]. For, it is said, he does not become ten years of age again. And not only doesn’t he become ten years of age again, (he doesn’t become) nine years of age or even one year of age. In this way, they call a Nigaṇṭha who is dead at the age of twenty years, and so on,nibbīso(‘twenty-less’),nittiṁso(‘thirty-less’),niccattālīso(‘forty-less’),nippaññāso(‘fifty-less’). When Ānanda was wandering in the village, he heard this discussion and reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said: ‘This is not a designation for the sectarians, Ānanda, but for the taint-destroyer (arahant) in my teaching.’ For if the taint-destroyer attains final nibbāna when he is ten years of age (or: has ten years’ seniority?), he does not become one of ten years again. Not only one of ten years, he doesn’t become one of nine years … of a single year. Not only one of a single year, he doesn’t become one of eleven months … nor even one of a single moment. Why? Because he never again takes rebirth. The same method for one who is ‘twenty-less’ and so on. Thus the Blessed One begins this teaching to show the causes for becoming one who is ‘ten-less.’\"What seven?"
