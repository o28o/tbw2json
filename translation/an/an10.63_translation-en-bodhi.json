    "an10.63:1": "\"Bhikkhus, all those who have reached certainty about me are accomplished in view. Of those accomplished in view, five gain the goal here in this world;[n.2084] There is a word play here. \"Have reached certainty about m6e\"(mayini ṭṭhaṁ gatā)is an idiom meaning that a person has achieved secure faith in the Buddha, the mark of a stream-enterer. Butniṭṭhāalso means goal, namely, arahantship. Thus reaching certainty about the Buddha marks the attainment of stream-entry (or higher stages), while gaining the goal marks the attainment of arahantship. In the light of this distinction,Mpexplains \"gain the goal here in this world\"(idha niṭṭhā)as \"reach final nibbāna in this very world\"(imasmiṁyeva loke parinibbānaṁ). \"This world\"(idha, lit., \"here\") obviously means the sense sphere, since the stream-enterer and once-returner may reach the goal in a heavenly realm and not necessarily in the human realm.Mpsays that \"having left this world\"(idha vihāya)means \"in the pure abodes of the brahmā world(suddhāvāsabrahmalokaṁ).\"five gain the goal having left this world."
