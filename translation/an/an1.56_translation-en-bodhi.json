    "an1.56:1": "\"Bhikkhus, whatever qualities are unwholesome, partake of the unwholesome, and pertain to the unwholesome, all have the mind as their forerunner.[n.50]Sabb’ete manopubbaṅgamā. Understood in line withDhp  and 2, the text probably means simply that before one commits any unwholesome bodily or verbal deed, one first decides to act in such a way. This gives the statement an ethical rather than a psychological meaning. This interpretation is supported by the next sentence about the mind arising first, followed by the others. The same applies to the wholesome mind and its qualities in the next sutta.Mind arises first followed by the unwholesome qualities.\""
