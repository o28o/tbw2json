    "an6.41:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and descended from Mount Vulture Peak together with a number of bhikkhus. In a certain place he saw a large block of wood and addressed the bhikkhus: \"Do you see, friends, that large block of wood?\"",
    "an6.41:2": "(1) \"If he so wished, friends, a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on that block of wood as earth. Whatis the basis for this? Because the earth element exists in that block of wood. On this basis a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on it as earth."
