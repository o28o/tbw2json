What four? () The domain of the Buddhas is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration. (2) The domain of one in jhāna is an inconceivable matter … (3) The result of kamma is an inconceivable matter … (4) Speculation about the world is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration.[n.772]Mpexplains the four as follows: \"Thedomain of the Buddhas(buddhavisaya)is the procedure and spiritual might(pavatti ca ānubhāvo ca)of the Buddha’s qualities such as the omniscient knowledge and so forth. Thedomain of one in jhāna(jhānavisaya)is the direct knowledges and jhānas. Theresult of kamma(kammavipāka)is the result of kamma to be experienced in the present life and so forth.Speculation about the world(lokacintā)is such worldly speculations as: ‘Who made the sun and moon? Who made the earth and the ocean? Who created sentient beings? Who made the mountains, mangoes, palmyras, and coconuts?’\"These are the four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration.\""
