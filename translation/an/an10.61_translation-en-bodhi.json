    "an10.61:1": "\"Bhikkhus, this is said: ‘A first point of ignorance, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no ignorance and afterward it came into being.’[n.208] I read this sentence thus: \"Purimā bhikkhave koṭi na paññāyati avijjāya,ito pubbe avijjā nāhosi atha pacchā samabhavī\"ti:evametaṁ bhikkhave vuccati.The punctuation in all three editions gives the impression that the only part of the Pāli sentence that forms a direct quotation is that betweenito pubbeandsambhavi. I think it more likely thatevametaṁ bhikkhave vuccatiapplies to the statement as a whole, frompurimāthroughsambhavi, rather than to only part of it, and I translate accordingly.Still, ignorance is seen to have a specific condition.",

It should be said: lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension? It should be said: careless attention. Careless attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for careless attention? It should be said: lack of faith. Lack of faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of faith? It should be said: not hearing the good Dhamma. Not hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: not associating with good persons.[n.083] Though there are only nine items in the first part of this sutta (the negative series), it appears to be included in the Tens because there are ten items in the second part (the positive series). The next sutta uses the same scheme but augmented in the first part by craving for existence.",
