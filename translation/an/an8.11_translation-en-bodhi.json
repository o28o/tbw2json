    "an8.11:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Verañjā at the foot of Naḷeru's neem tree.[n.637]Naḷerupucimandamūle.SpI 08,29–30says that Naḷeru was the name of a yakkha.Then a brahmin of Verañjāapproached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:",
    "an8.11:2": "\"I have heard, Master Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.’ This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama.\"[n.1638] A similar rebuke against the Buddha is voiced atAN4..",
    "an8.11:3": "(1) \"Master Gotama lacks taste.\"[n.169]Arasarūpo bhavaṁ Gotamo.Mp:\"The brahmin, lacking wisdom, did not recognize that the Buddha was the eldest in the world. Utterly unwilling to accept the Buddha’s statement, he spoke thus, referring to the ‘taste of concord’(sāmaggirasa), which in the world means paying homage, standing respectfully, reverential salutation, and polite conduct. To soften his mind, the Blessed One avoids directly contradicting him; instead he states that the term applies to him, but intending this in a different sense. (The Buddha speaks of ‘taste’) as the gratification in sensual pleasure that arises in worldlings—even in those considered the best by way of class or rebirth—who relish, welcome, and lust after objects such as forms, etc.\"",
    "an8.11:4": "(2) \"Master Gotama is not convivial.\"[n.160]Nibbhogo bhavaṁ Gotamo.Mpsays that the brahmin intended this in the sense that the Buddha lacks \"the enjoyment of concord\"(sāmaggiparibhogo, conviviality), by which he again refers to such respectful gestures as paying homage to elders, etc. But the Buddha speaks with reference to the lustful enjoyment of sensual pleasures that arises in ordinary beings.",
    "an8.11:5": "(3) \"Master Gotama is a proponent of non-doing.\"[n.1641]Akiriyavādo bhavaṁ Gotamo. The doctrine of non-doing, as expressed by its proponents, denies the distinction between good and evil. SeeDN 2.2, I 2,22–3,2;MN 60.9, I 404,21–3;MN 76.8, I 16,3–17;SN 24.6, III 208,20–209,6.Mpsays that the brahmin intended this in the sense that the Buddha did not act in accord with convention, as by paying homage to his elders, etc. But the Buddha spoke with reference to the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct.",
    "an8.11:6": "(4) \"Master Gotama is an annihilationist.\"[n.142]Ucchedavādo bhavaṁ Gotamo. The annihilationists proclaimed \"the annihilation, destruction, and extermination\" of a truly existent person at death. SeeDN 25–2, I 34,2–35,3.Mpsays that the brahmin intended to accuse the Buddha of seeking to annihilate the long-established conventions of paying homage to elders, etc., but the Buddha spoke with reference to the annihilation of all defilements and unwholesome qualities by the four noble paths.",
    "an8.11:7": "(5) \"Master Gotama is a repeller.\"[n.1643]Jegucchī bhavaṁ Gotamo.Mp:\"The brahmin calls the Blessed One a ‘repeller’(jegucchī); he thinks that because the Buddha is repelled(jigucchati)by polite conduct such as paying homage to elders, he does not do such things. But the Blessed One acknowledges this in a metaphorical sense. He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct and by the various bad unwholesome qualities, just as a man fond of ornaments would be repelled and disgusted by feces.\"",
    "an8.11:8": "(6) \"Master Gotama is an abolitionist.\"[n.1644]Venayiko bhavaṁ Gotamo. Venayika, from the verbvineti(to discipline, to remove), can mean \"one who imposes discipline, one who trains others.\" But in the Buddha’s time the wordvenayikaalso seems to have acquired the meaning of \"one who leads astray,\" who leads others to destruction. ThusMpglossesvineti, in the brahmin's view, withvināseti, \"destroys.\" But the Buddha affirms this in the sense that he teaches the Dhamma for the removal of lust and other defilements(rāgādīnaṁ vinayāya).",
    "an8.11:9": "(7) \"Master Gotama is a tormentor.\"[n.1645]Tapassī bhavaṁ Gotamo. Atapassīis usually an ascetic devoted to self-torment. The word is derived from the verbtapati, \"to burn up, to heat up.\" The brahmin, according toMp,uses the word in the sense of one who torments elders by not showing proper respect to them. But the Buddha uses the term to mean that he burns up unwholesome qualities.",
    "an8.11:10": "(8) \"Master Gotama is retiring.\"[n.1646]Apagabbho bhavaṁ Gotamo.SEDexplains Sktapagalbhaas \"wanting in boldness, embarrassed, perplexed\" (see too DOP svapagabbha). The Buddha plays on the word as if it meant \"rid of(apa)the womb(gabbha).\" It is nearly impossible to capture this pun in translation; my use of \"retiring\" is a clumsy attempt to bridge the two senses: \"timid\" and \"retired\" from wandering through the round of rebirths.",
    "an8.11:11": "\"Suppose, brahmin, there was a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs that she had properly covered, incubated, and nurtured. Should the first among those chicks to pierce its shell with the points of its claws or beak and safely hatch be called the eldest or the youngest?\"",
    "an8.11:12": "\"So too, brahmin, in a population immersed in ignorance, become like an egg, completely enveloped,[n.1647] SeeAN4.8§4.I have pierced the eggshell of ignorance. I am the sole person in the world who has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. So I am the eldest, the best in the world.",
    "an8.11:13": "\"My energy, brahmin, was aroused without slackening; my mindfulness was established without confusion; my body was tranquil without disturbance; my mind was concentrated and one-pointed. Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination.With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwelled equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experienced pleasure with the body; I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare:‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.",
    "an8.11:14": "\"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the recollection of past abodes.[n.1648] FollowingBeand Ee, I give the first two knowledges in full. Ce abridges them.I recollected my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus I recollected my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.",
    "an8.11:15": "\"This, brahmin, was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my first breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell.",
    "an8.11:16": "\"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: ‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.",
    "an8.11:17": "\"This, brahmin, was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my second breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell.",
    "an8.11:18": "\"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I understood as it really is:‘This is suffering’; I understood as it really is:‘This is the origin of suffering’; I understood as it really is:‘This is the cessation of suffering’; I understood as it really is:‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ I understood as it really is:‘These are the taints’;I understood as it really is:‘This is the origin of the taints’; I understood as it really is:‘This is the cessation of the taints’; I understood as it really is:‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.’",
    "an8.11:19": "\"This, brahmin, was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my third breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell.\"",
    "an8.11:20": "When this was said, the brahmin of Verañjā said to the Blessed One: \"Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.\""
