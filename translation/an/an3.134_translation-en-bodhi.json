    "an3.134:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of assemblies. What three? The assembly trained in vain talk, the assembly trained in interrogation, and the assembly trained to the limits. These are the three kinds of assemblies.\"[n.600] The first two are atAN2.47. On \"the assembly trained to the limits\" (Ceyāvatāvavinītā parisā; Beyāvatāvinītā parisā; Eeyāvatajjhāvinītā parisā),Mpsays: \"Trained by way of its capacity, meaning an assembly trained after one has known its capacity\"(pamāṇavasena vinītā, pamāṇaṁ ñatvā vinītaparisā ti attho). This seems to be a unique occurrence of the expression in the Nikāyas.Mpalso recognizes a readingyāvatajjhā, which it explains as \"an assembly trained after one has known its inclination\"(yāva ajjhāsayā ti attho, ajjhāsayaṁ ñatvā vinītaparisā ti vuttaṁ hoti). Vanarata prefers a Burmese variant mentioned in a note in Ee,yāvatajjanīvinītā parisā, which he understands to be \"an assembly that gives in to training only as long as(yāva)threats are applied.\""
