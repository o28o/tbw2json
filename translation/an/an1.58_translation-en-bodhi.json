Laxity of mind, looseness of mind, in regard to bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and the five kinds of sensual pleasures; and disrespect for the cultivation of wholesome qualities without persevering and persisting in this. (It is) looseness of procedure, lack of desire, non-commitment, non-determination, non-devotion, non-pursuit, non-development, and non-cultivation (of wholesome qualities).\"For one who is heedless, unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline.\""
