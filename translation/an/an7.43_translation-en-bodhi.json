    "an7.43:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kosambī for alms. It then occurred to him: \"It is still too early to walk for alms in Kosambī. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects.\"",
    "an7.43:2": "Now on that occasion those wanderers had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them: \"Friends, anyone at all who lives the complete and purified spiritual life for twelve years is fit to be called a bhikkhu who is ‘ten-less.’\"",
    "an7.43:3-5": "Then the Venerable Ānanda neither delighted in nor rejected the statement of those wanderers, but rose from his seat and left,thinking: \"I shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement.\"",
    "an7.43:6": "\"In this Dhamma and discipline, Ānanda, it isn’t possible to describe a bhikkhu as ‘ten-less’ by the mere counting of years. There are, Ānanda, these seven bases forbeing‘ten-less’ that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge.",
    "an7.43:7": "What seven? Here, a bhikkhu has (1) faith, (2) a sense of moral shame, (3) moral dread; (4) he is learned, (5) energetic, (6) mindful, and () wise. These are the seven bases forbeing‘ten-less’ that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge."
