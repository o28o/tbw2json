Now on that occasion King Muṇḍa'swifeQueen Bhaddā, who had been dear and beloved to him, had died. Since her death, he did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remained brooding over Queen Bhaddā's body. Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka: \"Well then, friend Piyaka,immerse Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclose it in another iron vat so that we can see Queen Bhaddā's body still longer.\"",
    "an5.50:2": "Then it occurred to the treasurer Piyaka: \"King Muṇḍa'swifeQueen Bhaddā has died, and she was dear and beloved to him. Since her death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. What ascetic or brahmin can King Muṇḍa visit, so that, having heard his Dhamma, he might abandon the dart of sorrow?\"",
    "an5.50:3": "Then it occurred to Piyaka: \"The Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pāṭaliputta, in the Cock's Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: ‘He is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, an artful speaker, eloquent, mature, and an arahant.’ Suppose King Muṇḍa would visit the Venerable Nārada: perhaps if he hears the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, he would abandon the dart of sorrow.\"",

Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: ‘He is wise … and an arahant.’ Your majesty should visit the Venerable Nārada. Perhaps, when you hear the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, you would abandon the dart of sorrow.\"The king said:\"Well then, friend Piyaka,inform the Venerable Nārada. For how can one like me think of approaching an ascetic or brahmin living in his realm without first informing him?\"",

Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. It would be good, Bhante, if the Venerable Nārada would teach the Dhamma to King Muṇḍa in such a way that he can abandon the dart of sorrow.\"",
    "an5.50:6": "Then the treasurer Piyaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Nārada, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to King Muṇḍa. He told the king: \"Sire, the Venerable Nārada has given his consent. You may go at your own convenience.\"",
    "an5.50:7": "Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage, and along with the other carriages he set out in full royal splendor for the Cock's Park to see the Venerable Nārada. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. He approached the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.The Venerable Nārada then said to him:",

When this happens, he does not reflect thus: ‘I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.’ Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused.

This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself. Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes nibbāna.[n.1043] The text uses a reflexive causative form:attānaṁyeva parinibbāpeti. This might also have been rendered: \"He extinguishes himself,\" or \"He quenches himself.\" What is literally extinguished is the bitter feeling of sorrow, but the verbparinibbāpeti, related to the nounnibbāna, implies that he reaches ultimate liberation.",
