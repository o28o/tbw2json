    "an2.14:1": "\"Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has these two kinds of Dhamma teaching. What two? In brief and in detail.[n.230]Saṅkhittena ca vitthārena ca.Mp:\"A brief teaching is one expounded briefly by reciting the outline(mātikā). A detailed teaching is one expounded by elaborating and analyzing the outline(mātikaṁ vitthārato vibhajitvā kathitā). But whether or not an outline is set up, a teaching spoken with elaboration and analysis is called a detailed teaching. The brief teaching is spoken for a person with great wisdom, a detailed teaching for a person whose intellect is blunter …. Though the entire Tipiṭaka is a brief teaching, it is here considered a detailed teaching.\"The Tathāgata has these two kinds of Dhamma teaching.\""
