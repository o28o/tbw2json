Without having fulfilled virtuous behavior, (4) it is impossible that he will abandon sensual lust, (5) lust for form, or (6) lust for the formless.[n.427] The Abhidhamma commentary, As 239,25–240,2(Be §362), explainsrūparāgaas \"desire and lust for form-(sphere) existence\"(rūpabhave chandarāgo)andarūparāgaas \"desire and lust for formless-(sphere) existence\"(arūpabhave chandarāgo). While the word \"lust\" may seem strong in relation to these refined realms of existence, I feel it is useful to renderrāgaconsistently.",
