    "an5.70:1": "\"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints. What five? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. These five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints.\""
