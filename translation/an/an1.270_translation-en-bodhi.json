    "an1.270:1": "\"It is impossible and inconceivable, bhikkhus, that a person accomplished in view could consider anything as a self; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that a worldling might consider something as a self; there is such a possibility.\"[n.52]Mp:\"In the section on self, instead of speaking of a ‘conditioned phenomenon’(saṅkhāra), the expression ‘anything’(kañci dhammaṁ)is used; this is for the purpose of including conceptual entities such as thekasiṇas, etc. (seeAN.455–64). Whatever the worldling grasps as permanent, pleasurable, and self, the noble disciple disentangles himself from its grip, considering it as impermanent, suffering, and non-self.\""
