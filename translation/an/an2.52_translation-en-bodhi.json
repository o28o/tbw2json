    "an2.52:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two people who arise in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. What two? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One and the wheel-turning monarch. These are the two people who arise in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.\"[n.290]Mp:\"Because the wheel-turning monarch is mentioned, the phrase, ‘out of compassion for the world’(lokānukampāya)is not used.\" On the wheel-turning monarch(rājā cakkavatī), seeAN.278, n. 56."
