    "an1.53:1": "\"Bhikkhus, if for just the time of a finger snap a bhikkhu pursues a mind of loving-kindness, he is called a bhikkhu who is not devoid of jhāna, who acts upon the teaching of the Teacher, who responds to his advice, and who does not eat the country's almsfood in vain.[n.49]Mpsays that by \"pursues a mind of loving-kindness\"(mettācittaṁ āsevati), the text refers to the mere pervasion of all beings with a wish for their well-being. Thus it seems that here \"not devoid of jhāna\"(arittajjhāno)does not necessarily mean that the monk actually attains one of the four jhānas but that he earnestly engages in meditation. The phrase \"does not eat the country's almsfood in vain\" means that by practicing meditation, the monk is worthy to receive almsfood from laypeople. He enables the donors to acquire merit and uses the almsfood properly to support the spiritual life.How much more, then, those who cultivate it!\""
