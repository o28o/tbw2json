    "an8.8:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Uttarā was dwelling at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sankheyya. There the Venerable Uttarā addressed the bhikkhus ….",
    "an8.8:2": "Now on that occasion the greatdevaking Vessavaṇa was traveling from north to south on some business. He heard the Venerable Uttarā at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sankheyya, teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings … the failings of others … his own achievements … the achievements of others.’",
    "an8.8:3": "Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Vessavaṇa disappeared from Mount Sankheyya and reappeared among the Tāvatiṁsa devas.",
    "an8.8:4": "Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Sakka disappeared from among the Tāvatiṁsa devas and reappeared at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sankheyya, in front of the Venerable Uttarā. He approached the Venerable Uttarā, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:",
    "an8.8:5": "\"Is it true, Bhante, as is said, that you have been teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings … the failings of others … his own achievements … the achievements of others’?\"",
    "an8.8:6": "Suppose not far from a village or town there was a great heap of grain, and a large crowd of people were to take away grain with carrying-poles, baskets, hip-sacks,and their cupped hands. If someone were to approach that large crowd of people and ask them: ‘Where did you get this grain?’ what should they say?\"",
    "an8.8:7": "\"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well you stated this: ‘Whatever is well spoken is all the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I myself and others derive our good words from him.’",
    "an8.8:8": "‘Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. It is good for him from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for him from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for him from time to time to review the achievements of others. Because he was over come and obsessed by eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. What eight?",
    "an8.8:9": "\"It is good for a bhikkhu to overcome gain whenever it arises. It is good for him to overcome loss whenever it arises … to overcome fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.",
    "an8.8:10": "\"And for what reason should a bhikkhu overcome gain whenever it arises? For what reason should he overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises?",
    "an8.8:11": "Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen gain do not occur in one who has overcome it. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen loss … arisen fame … arisen disrepute … arisen honor … arisen lack of honor … arisen evil desires … arisen bad friendship do not occur in one who has overcome it. For this reason a bhikkhu should overcome gain whenever it arises. He should overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.",
    "an8.8:12": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will overcome gain whenever it arises. We will overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.\"[n.1628] It is probable that this sutta was put in the Eights because of the eight bad conditions mentioned in the discourse about Devadatta.",
    "an8.8:13": "\"Bhante Uttarā, this exposition of the Dhamma has not been promulgated anywhere among the four human assemblies: that is, among bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers.[n.1629] It is hard to see on what basis Sakka says that this exposition of the Dhamma had not been established anywhere among the four assemblies(n’āyaṁ dhammapariyāyo kismiñci patiṭṭhito). The discourse on knowing one's own failings and achievements had already been taught to the bhikkhus, who are likely to have taught it to the other three assemblies.Bhante, learn this exposition of the Dhamma, master this exposition of the Dhamma, and retain this exposition of the Dhamma in mind. This exposition of the Dhamma is beneficial; it pertains to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.\""
