    "an3.21:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side. The Venerable Sāriputta then said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha:",
    "an3.21:2": "\"Friend Saviṭṭha, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The body witness, the one attained to view, and the one liberated by faith.[n.355] For formal explanations of these three types, seeMN 70.19–1, I 478,4–479,3. All three classes aresekhasranging from the stream-enterer through one on the path to arahantship. As general classes, they differ, not in their position relative to the final goal, but in their dominant spiritual faculty. The body witness(kāyasakkhī)gives prominence to concentration and attains the \"peaceful formless emancipations.\" One attained to view(diṭṭhippatta)gives prominence to wisdom and does not attain the formless emancipations. One liberated by faith(saddhāvimutta)gives prominence to faith and does not attain the formless emancipations. Because these three categories comprise persons standing anywhere from stream-enterer to the path to arahantship, their members cannot be prejudged as superior and inferior merely by falling into a particular class. To make such judgments, one would have to know their standing in terms of the six levels they each comprise. The body witness, on attaining arahantship, becomes \"liberated in both respects\"(ubhatobhāgavimutta). The other two become \"liberated by wisdom\"(paññāvimutta). On the two types of arahant, seeMN 70.18, I 477,4–478,3.These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world. Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?\"",
    "an3.21:3": "\"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one liberated by faith to be the most excellent and sublime.[n.56] In the Pāli, each participant in the discussion repeats the opening statement about the three persons before expressing his own opinion. To avoid redundancy, I have deleted this repetition.For what reason? Because this person's faculty of faith is predominant.\"",
    "an3.21:4": "Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita: \"Friend Koṭṭhita, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world ….Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?\"",
    "an3.21:5": "\"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the body witness to be the most excellent and sublime. For what reason? Because this person's faculty of concentration is predominant.\"",
    "an3.21:6": "Then the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to the Venerable Sāriputta: \"Friend Sāriputta, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world …. Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?\"",
    "an3.21:7": "\"Friend Koṭṭhita, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one attained to view to be the most excellent and sublime. For what reason? Because this person's faculty of wisdom is predominant.\"",
    "an3.21:8": "Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita: \"Friends, we have each explained according to our own ideal. Come, let's approach the Blessed One and report this matter to him. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us..",
    "an3.21:9": "The Blessed One said:\"It isn’t easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: ‘Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime..",
    "an3.21:10": "It isn’t easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: ‘Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime..",
