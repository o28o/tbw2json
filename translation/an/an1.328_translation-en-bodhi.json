    "an1.328:1": "\"Bhikkhus, just as even a trifling amount of feces is foul smelling, so too I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence, even for a mere finger snap.\"[n.79]Mpexplains that after the Buddha had given a discourse on the rebirth of beings, saying that there are nine persons \"freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits\" (seeAN9.2), he considered: \"If the bhikkhus, on hearing this discourse, think: ‘We are freed from hell, etc.,’ they may think there is no need to strive for the higher paths and fruits. Let me then stir up a sense of urgency in them.\" Mp glosses the words, \"I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence,\" with: \"I do not praise rebirth in any realm of existence even for a short time\"(appamattakampi kālaṁ bhave paṭisandhiṁ na vaṇṇayāmi)."
