    "an5.211:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, five dangers can be expected for him. What five? () He either commits apārājikaand cuts off the outlet,[n.29]Chinnaparipantho.Mpexplains that he has cut off the world-transcending outlet(lokuttaraparipanthassa chinnattā chinnaparipantho), but possibly what is meant is that, having committed apārājika, which requires expulsion from the Saṅgha, he has no way to preserve his status as a bhikkhu.or (2) commits a certain defiled offense,[n.220]Aññataraṁ saṅkiliṭṭhaṁ āpattiṁ āpajjati. This sometimes means that he commits apārājikaor asaṅghādisesaoffense, but since apārājikawas just mentioned, it must refer to asaṅghādisesa.or (3) contracts a severe illness. (4) He dies confused. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. When a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, these five dangers can be expected for him.\""
