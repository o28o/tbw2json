Here, someone has engaged in bodily good conduct and avoided engaging in bodily misconduct; engaged in verbal good conduct and avoided engaging in verbal misconduct; engaged in mental good conduct and avoided engaging in mental misconduct. He is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have engaged in bodily good conduct’; he is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have avoided engaging in bodily misconduct’; he is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have engaged in verbal good conduct’; he is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have avoided engaging in verbal misconduct’; he is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have engaged in mental good conduct’; he is not tormented,knowing: ‘I have avoided engaging in mental misconduct.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things that do not cause torment.\""
