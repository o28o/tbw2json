    "an3.47:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics that define the conditioned.[n.405]Sankhatassa saṅkhatalakkhaṇāni. Lit. \"three conditioned characteristics of the conditioned.\" And belowasaṅkhatassa asaṅkhatalakkhaṇāni, lit. \"three unconditioned characteristics of the unconditioned.\" I render these expressions in the way I have to avoid giving the wrong impression that the characteristics themselves are conditioned or unconditioned. The point, rather, is that they determine as such the conditioned and the unconditioned.What three? An arising is seen, a vanishing is seen, and its alteration while it persists is seen. These are the three characteristics that define the conditioned."
