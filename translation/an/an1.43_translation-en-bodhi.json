    "an1.43:1": "\"Here, bhikkhus, having encompassed a mentally corrupted person's mind with my own mind, I understand that if this person were to die at this time, he would be deposited in hell as if brought there.[n.40]Yathābhataṁ nikkhitto. I translate this idiom on the basis ofMp'sgloss:yathā āharitvā ṭhapito.For what reason? Because his mind is corrupted.[n.4]Mp:\"A mind corrupted by hate\"(dosena paduṭṭhacittaṁ). This sutta and the following might be seen as prose elaborations ofDhp and 2although those verses usemanorather thancitta, the adjectives are the same:paduṭṭhaandpasanna.It is because of mental corruption that with the breakup of the body, after death, some beings here are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.\""
