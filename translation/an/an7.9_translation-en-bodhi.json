    "an7.9:1": "\"Bhikkhus, the spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate seven fetters. What seven?The fetter of compliance, the fetter of aversion, the fetter of views, the fetter of doubt, the fetter of conceit, the fetter of lust for existence, and the fetter of ignorance. The spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate these seven fetters."
