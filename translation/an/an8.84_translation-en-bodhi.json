() An unskilled thief attacks those who should not be attacked, such as old people, children, and virtuous people who are not his enemies and who don’t attack him. (2) A skillful thief should take only half of what is available; for example, if there are two articles of clothing he should take only one; of portions of food, he should take one for himself and leave the otherhe can take the superior item for himself. (7) An unskilled thief commits theft in a nearby village, town, or city. (8) An unskilled thief does not purify the path to the other world by \"depositing\" a portion of his spoils in gifts to those \"worthy of offerings\"(yaṁ laddhaṁ, taṁ dakkhiṇeyye nidahituṁ cheko na hoti, paralokamaggaṁ na sodheti). Presumably a skillful thief will \"deposit\" part of his plunder by offering it to worthy monks and thereby \"purify the path to the other world.\"Possessing these eight factors, a master thief quickly gets into trouble and does not last long.",
