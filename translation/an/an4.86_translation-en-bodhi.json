    "an4.86:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The one bent down who bends lower, the one bent down who rises, the one risen who bends down, and the one risen who rises higher.[n.777]Cedefines these four types with exactly the same explanations given inAN4.85. Be and Ee, however, offer no explanations but merely give the headings."
