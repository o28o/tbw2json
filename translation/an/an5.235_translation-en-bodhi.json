    "an5.235:1": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a resident bhikkhu shows compassion to laypeople. What five? () He encourages them in regard to virtuous behavior. (2) He settles them in the vision of the Dhamma.[n.23]Dhammadassane niveseti.Mp:\"He establishes them in the seeing of the Dhamma of the four (noble) truths.\"(3) When they are ill he approaches them and arouses mindfulness in them, saying:‘Let the honorable ones establish mindfulness on that which is worthy.’[n.232]Arahaggataṁ āyasmanto satiṁ upaṭṭhāpetha.Mp:\"Establish respect for the three bases (of faith), gone (for refuge) only to the Triple Gem, which is worthy of all honors.\" The texts occasionally useāyasmantoas an address of monks to laypeople. Apparently the word could be used to address anyone considered worthy of esteem and was not solely an honorific for monks.(4) When a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived, including bhikkhus from various states, he approaches laypeople and informs them: ‘Friends, a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus has arrived including bhikkhus from various states. Make merit. It is an occasion to make merit.’ (5) He himself eats whatever food they give him, whether coarse or excellent; he does not squander what has been given out of faith. Possessing these five qualities, a resident bhikkhu shows compassion to laypeople.\""
