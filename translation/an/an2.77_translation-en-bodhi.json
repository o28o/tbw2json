    "an2.77:1": "\"Bhikkhus, bad unwholesome qualities arise with a basis, not without a basis. With the abandoning of this basis, these bad unwholesome qualities do not occur.\"[n.307]Mp:\"‘With a basis’ means ‘with a reason.’ The same method applies in the following suttas. For the words ‘source,’ ‘cause,’ ‘causal activity,’ ‘condition,’ and ‘form’ are all just synonyms for ‘reason’\"(Sanimittāti sakāraṇā….Nidānaṁ hetu saṅkhāro paccayo rūpan ti sabbāni pi hi etāni kāraṇavevacanān’eva)."
