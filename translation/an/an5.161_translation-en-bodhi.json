    "an5.161:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone.[n.57]Yattha bhikkhuno uppanno āghāto sabbaso paṭivinetabbo. I interpret this followingMp,which explains: \"When resentment has arisen in a bhikkhuin regard to some object(yattha ārammaṇe), it should be completely dispelled there in these five ways.\" ThusMptakesyatthato mean the person toward whom the resentment has arisen, not the physical place where it has arisen.What five? () One should develop loving-kindness for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (2) One should develop compassion for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (3) One should develop equanimity toward the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person.(4) One should disregard the person one resents and pay no attention to him; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (5) One should apply the idea of the ownership of kamma to the person one resents, thus: ‘This venerable one is the owner of his kamma, the heir of his kamma; he has kamma as his origin, kamma as his relative, kamma as his resort; he will be the heir of any kamma he does, good or bad.’ In this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. These are the five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone.\""
