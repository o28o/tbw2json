    "an1.12:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen ill will arises and arisen ill will increases and expands so much as the mark of the repulsive.[n.24]Paṭighanimitta.Mp:\"This denotes a disagreeable mark; it is a designation for aversion (repulsion) and for a repulsive object\"(aniṭṭhaṁ nimittaṁ; paṭighassapi paṭighassārammaṇassapi etaṁ adhivacanaṁ).Interestingly,Mpcontinues with a citation from \"the commentary\": \"For it is said in the commentary: ‘The mark of the repulsive is aversion (repulsion) and a repulsive object’\"(vuttampi c’etaṁ aṭṭhakathāyaṁ paṭighampi paṭighanimittaṁ, paṭighārammaṇopi dhammo paṭighanimittan ti). Mp-ṭ identifies \"the commentary\" as \"the Great Commentary\"(mahā aṭṭhakathā), one of the ancient Sinhala commentaries that Buddhaghosa used as the source for his own commentaries. These ancient commentaries are no longer extant, but this allusion makes it clear that Buddhaghosa worked with sources and did not write original compositions.For one who attends carelessly to the mark of the repulsive, unarisen ill will arises and arisen ill will increases and expands.\""
