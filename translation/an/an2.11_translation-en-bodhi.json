    "an2.11:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development.",
    "an2.11:2": "\"And what is the power of development? The power of development is the power of trainees.[n.9] Cesekhametaṁ balaṁ; Besekhānametaṁ balaṁ; Eesekhānaṁ etaṁ balaṁ.Mp:\"The power of knowledge of the seven kinds of trainees.\" The seven kinds of trainees extend from the person on the path of stream-entry through the person on the path of arahantship. Thus they include all the noble persons except the arahant, who isasekha, \"one beyond training.\"For relying on the power of a trainee, one abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one does not do anything unwholesome; one does not pursue anything bad. This is called the power of development."
