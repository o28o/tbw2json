    "an1.6:1": "[n.2]Mp:\"It is not only men who esteem the five sense objects but women too. therefore the next five suttas are formulated with women as the subject.\"\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other form that so obsesses the mind of a woman as the form of a man. The form of a man obsesses the mind of a woman.\""
