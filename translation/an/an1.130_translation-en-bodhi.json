    "an1.130:1": "\"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma are acting for the harm of many people, the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings.[n.6]Mp:\"The ten courses of wholesome kamma are Dhamma; the ten courses of unwholesome kamma are non-Dhamma. So too, the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment—namely, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path—are Dhamma; three establishments of mindfulness, three right strivings, three bases of spiritual power, six faculties, six powers, eight factors of enlightenment, and a ninefold path (are non-Dhamma.) The four types of clinging, the five hindrances, the seven underlying tendencies, and the eight kinds of wrongness (the opposites of the noble path factors) are non-Dhamma. They teach non-Dhamma as Dhamma when they select one type of non-Dhamma and think, ‘We will teach this as Dhamma. In that way our teacher's group will be emancipating, and we will become famous in the world.’ By the Vinaya method, Dhamma is a disciplinary action that should be done according to the claim, after having reprimanded, after having reminded, according to a true base. Non-Dhamma is a disciplinary action done without a claim, without having reprimanded, without having reminded, according to a false base.\"These bhikkhus generate much demerit and cause this good Dhamma to disappear.\""
