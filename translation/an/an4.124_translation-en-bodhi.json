    "an4.124:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?",
    "an4.124:2": "() \"Again, some person, with the subsiding of thought and examination, enters and dwells in the second jhāna …. (3) With the fading away as well of rapture … he enters and dwells in the third jhāna …. (4) With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He contemplates whatever phenomena there pertain to form, feeling, perception, volitional activities, and consciousness as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as empty, as non-self. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the pure abodes. This is a rebirth not shared with worldlings."
