    "an7.33:1": "\"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove,approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Saṅgha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration, reverence for a sense of moral shame, and reverence for moral dread. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.\"",
    "an7.33:2": "Respectful toward the Teacher,respectful toward the Dhamma,deeply revering the Saṅgha,respectful toward concentration, ardent,deeply respectful toward the training;",
    "an7.33:3": "Endowed with moral shame and moral dread,deferential and reverential:such a one cannot fall awaybut is close to nibbāna."
