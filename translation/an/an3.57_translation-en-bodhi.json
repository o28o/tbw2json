    "an3.57:1": "Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One … and said to him.",
    "an3.57:2": "\"Those, Vaccha, who say: ‘The ascetic Gotama says: \"Alms should be given only to me … only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others,\"’ do not state what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact. One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for three people. What three? He creates an obstruction to the donor's acquiring merit, to the recipients’ gaining a gift, and already he has maimed and injured himself. One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for these three people.",
    "an3.57:3": "\"But, Vaccha, I say that one acquires merit even if one throws away dishwashing water in a refuse dump or cesspit with the thought: ‘May the living beings here sustain themselves with this!’ How much more, then, (does one acquire merit) when one gives to human beings! However, I say that what is given to one of virtuous behavior is more fruitful than (what is given) to an immoral person. And (the most worthy recipient) is one who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors.",
    "an3.57:4": "\"What five factors has he abandoned? Sensual desire, ill will, dullnessand drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five factors that he has abandoned.",
    "an3.57:5": "\"And what five factors does he possess? The virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. These are the five factors that he possesses.",
    "an3.57:6-7": "Among cattle of any sort,whether black, white, red, or golden,mottled, uniform, or pigeon-colored,the tamed bull is born,the one that can bear the load,possessing strength, advancing with good speed.They yoke the burden just to him;they are not concerned about his color.",
    "an3.57:8-11": "So too, among human beingsit is in any kind of birth—among khattiyas, brahmins, vessas,suddas, caṇḍālas, or scavengers—among people of any sortthat the tamed person of good manners is born:one firm in Dhamma, virtuous in conduct,truthful in speech, endowed with moral shame;one who has abandoned birth and death,consummate in the spiritual life,with the burden dropped, detached,who has done his task, free of taints;who has gone beyond all things (of the world)and by non-clinging has reached nibbāna:an offering is truly vastwhen planted in that spotless field.",
    "an3.57:12-14": "Fools devoid of understanding,dull-witted, unlearned,do not attend on the holy ones[n.417]Mpsays that the \"holy ones\"(sante)are the supreme persons(uttamapurise): Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and arahants.but give their gifts to those outside.Those, however, who attend on the holy ones,on the wise ones esteemed as sagely,[n.418]Sappaññe dhīrasammate.Mpglosses this as if it meant \"esteemed, honored, by the learned\"(paṇḍitehi sammate sambhāvite), but I takedhīrasammateto mean \"esteemed, honored, as sagely (or wise).\"and those whose faith in the Fortunate Oneis deeply rooted and well established,go to the world of the devasor are born here in a good family.Advancing in successive steps,those wise ones attain nibbāna."
