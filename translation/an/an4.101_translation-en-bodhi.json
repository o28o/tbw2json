    "an4.101:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "an4.101:2": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clouds. What four? The one that thunders but does not rain; the one that rains but does not thunder; the one that neither thunders nor rains; and the one that both thunders and rains. These are the four kinds of clouds. So too, there are these four kinds of persons similar to clouds found existing in the world. What four? The one who thunders but does not rain; the one who rains but does not thunder; the one who neither thunders nor rains; and the one who both thunders and rains.",
