    "an7.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "an7.1:2": "\"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu is desirous of gains, () honor, and (3) reputation;[n.1455]Anavaññattikāmo. Lit., \"desirous of not being looked down upon.\"Mp:\"He desires to be well known\"(abhiññātabhāvakāmo). Thoughts about one's reputation(anavaññattipaṭisaṁyutto vitakko)is a type of distracting thought that must be overcome to gain concentration; seeAN3.101, I 54,3.(4) he is morally shameless and (5) morally reckless; (6) he has evil desires and (7) holds wrong view. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.",

What seven?Here, (1) a bhikkhu is not desirous of gains, or (2) honor, or () a reputation; (4) he has a sense of moral shame and (5) moral dread; (6) he has few desires and (7) holds right view. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them.\""
