    "an8.31:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these eight gifts.[n.696] The fifth, sixth, and eighth motives for giving are also atAN7.52.What eight? () Having insultedthe recipient, one gives a gift.[n.697]Āsajja dānaṁ deti.Mp:\"One gives a gift when someone has arrived. Having seen one who has come, one instantly makes him sit down, honors him, and gives him a gift. One thinks, ‘I will give,’ but does not trouble him.\" This explanation takesāsajjato be the absolutive ofāsīdati, glossed byMpasnisīdāpetvā, \"having made sit down.\" In the Nikāyas, however,āsajjanever seems to bear this sense but always means \"having insulted, having offended, having encroached upon.\" Since this type of giving occurs first in what is clearly a graded list, the usual meaning ofāsajjais more pertinent.(2) One gives a gift from fear. (3) One gives a gift,thinking: ‘He gave to me.’ (4) One gives a gift,thinking: ‘He will give to me.’ (5) One gives a gift,thinking: ‘Giving is good.’ (6) One gives a gift,thinking: ‘I cook; these people do not cook. It isn’t right that I who cook should not give to those who do not cook.’ (7) One gives a gift,thinking: ‘Because I have given this gift, I will gain a good reputation.’ (8) One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind, equipping the mind.\"[n.698] All three editions havecittālaṅkāracittaparikkhāratthaṁ dānaṁ deti.SeeAN7.52, whereCehascittālaṅkāraṁ cittaparikkhāranti dānaṁ deti.Mp:\"For the purpose of ornamenting and equipping the mind with serenity and insight.\""
