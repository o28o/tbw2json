The happiness of ownership, the happiness of enjoyment, the happiness of freedom from debt, and the happiness of blamelessness.[n.748] In Pāli:atthisukha, bhogasukha, anaṇasukha, anavajjasukha.Mp:\"The first is the happiness arisen at the thought, ‘There is(atthi, i.e., wealth)’; the second is the happiness arisen in one who enjoys wealth; the third is the happiness arisen at the thought, ‘I am without debt’; the fourth is the happiness arisen at the thought, ‘I am faultless, blameless.’\"",
    "an4.62:3": "(1) \"And what, householder, is the happiness of ownership? Here, a clansman has acquired wealth by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. When he thinks, ‘I have acquired wealth by energetic striving … righteously gained,’ he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of ownership.",

The first three types make up one portion, the happiness of blamelessness is a portion in its own right. Then he sees with wisdom and knows that the former three types of happiness combined are not worth a sixteenth part of the happiness of blamelessness.\""
