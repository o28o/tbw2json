    "an4.134:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One who lives off the fruit of his effort but not off the fruit of his kamma; one who lives off the fruit of his kamma but not off the fruit of his effort; one who lives off the fruit of both his effort and his kamma; and one who lives off the fruit of neither his effort nor his kamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.\"[n.832]Mp:\"One who lives off the fruit of his effort but not off the fruit of his kamma: This is one who passes the day energetically exerting himself and lives off whatever he gains as the consequential fruit of this, but does not obtain any meritorious fruits as a result of his exertion.One who lives off the fruit of his kamma but not off the fruit of his effort: These are all the devas, from (the heaven of) the four great kings up, who live off their meritorious fruits without energetically exerting themselves.One who lives off the fruit of both his effort and his kamma: These are kings and royal ministers, etc.One who lives off the fruit of neither his effort nor his kamma: These are the beings in hell. In this sutta, by ‘fruit of kamma,’ only meritorious fruit is intended.\""
