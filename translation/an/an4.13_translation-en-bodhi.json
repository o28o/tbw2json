    "an4.13:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four right strivings. What four? () Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (3) He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (4) He generates desire for the persistence of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings.\"",
    "an4.13:2": "Those who strive rightlyovercome the realm of Māra;they are unattached,gone beyond fear of birth and death.They are contented and unstirred,having conquered Māra and his mount;those happy ones have overcomeall Namuci's armies.[n.641] \"Namuci\": a name for Māra, which the commentaries explain as \"he does not(na)set free(muci).\""
