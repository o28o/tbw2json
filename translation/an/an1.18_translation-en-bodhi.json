    "an1.18:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen dullness and drowsiness do not arise and arisen dullness and drowsiness are abandoned so much as the element of instigation, the element of persistence, the element of exertion.[n.33]Ārambhadhātu,nikkamadhātu,parakkamadhātu.Mpexplains these as three successively more powerful degrees of energy.For one who has aroused energy, unarisen dullness and drowsiness do not arise and arisen dullness and drowsiness are abandoned.\"[n.34]Mpmentions six other things that lead to the abandoning of dullness and drowsiness: moderation in food, change of posture, the perception of light, living out in the open, good friendship, and suitable conversation. For moderation in food,Mp(in line with other commentaries) suggests that when one still has room for four or five more mouthfuls, one should stop eating and drink water."
