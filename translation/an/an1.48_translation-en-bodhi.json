    "an1.48:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that changes so quickly as the mind.[n.45]Mp,using the Abhidhamma model of the mind, takes this to refer to the extreme speed with which the mind arises and vanishes. But in the Vinaya atKhandaka 3 verse 76, in a passage on the conditions that entitle a bhikkhu to cut short his rains observance, it is said that if a woman is trying to seduce a bhikkhu at his rains residence, he is entitled to depart after reflecting: \"The Blessed One said that the mind is quick to change, and here there is an obstacle to my living the celibate life.\" In this context, the obvious sense is not that the mind arises and ceases quickly but that one might suddenlychange one's mind, giving up the celibate life to submit to the charms of the woman.It is not easy to give a simile for how quickly the mind changes.\""
