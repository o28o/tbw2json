    "an5.226:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers when a bhikkhu who visits families bonds too closely with them. What five? () He often gets to see women. (2) When he often gets to see them, he bonds with them. (3) When he bonds with them, they become intimate. (4) When they become intimate, lust finds an opening. (5) When his mind is in the grip of lust, it can be expected that he will lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, commit a certain defiled offense, or give up the training and return to the lower life.[n.226] On the defiled offense, seeAN5.80, n.Â 089.These are the five dangers when a bhikkhu who visits families bonds too closely with them.\""
