    "an1.45:1": "\"Bhikkhus, suppose there were a pool of water that was cloudy, turbid, and muddy. Then a man with good sight standing on the bank could not see shells, gravel and pebbles, and shoals of fish swimming about and resting. For what reason? Because the water is cloudy. So too, it is impossible for a bhikkhu with a cloudy mind to know his own good, the good of others, or the good of both, or to realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. For what reason? Because his mind is cloudy.\"[n.43]Mp:\"Cloudy(ƒÅvilena): enveloped by the five hindrances.\" AtAN5.93cloudy water is specifically identified with doubt and limpid water with freedom from doubt."
