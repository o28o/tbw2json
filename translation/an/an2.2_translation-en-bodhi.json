    "an2.2:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world. What two? The striving of laypeople who dwell at home for the purpose of presentingmonastics withrobes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and the striving of those who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. These are the two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world.",
    "an2.2:2": "\"Of these two strivings, bhikkhus, the foremost is the striving for the relinquishment of all acquisitions.[n.19]Sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga.Mpspecifies three types of \"acquisitions\"(upadhi): the five aggregates, the defilements, and volitional activities(khandha,kilesa,abhisaṅkhārā). The relinquishment of these is a synonym for nibbāna. The striving for this is the energy arisen along with insight and the path.Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will strive for the relinquishment of all acquisitions.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.\""
