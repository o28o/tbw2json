    "an10.64:1": "\"Bhikkhus, all those who have unwavering confidence in me are stream-enterers.[n.2087] Here the text uses the wordsotāpannain a loose sense.Mpsays it means those who have entered the \"stream\" of the noble path(ariyamaggasotaṁ āpannā). The word thus applies to disciples atall four stagesof awakening.Of those stream-enterers, five gain the goal here in this world; five gain the goal having left this world."
