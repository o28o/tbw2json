    "an5.146:1": "\"Bhikkhus, one should not take as a friend a bhikkhu who possesses five qualities. What five? He instigates work projects; he takes up disciplinary issues; he is hostile toward eminent bhikkhus; he is intent on lengthy and unsettled wandering; he is unable to instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden one from time to time with a Dhamma talk. One should not take as a friend a bhikkhu who possesses these five qualities.",
