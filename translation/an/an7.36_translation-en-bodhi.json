    "an7.36:1": "\"Bhikkhus, one should associate with a friend who possesses seven factors. What seven? () He gives what is hard to give. (2) He does what is hard to do. (3) He patiently endures what is hard to endure. (4) He reveals his secrets to you. (5) He preserves your secrets. (6) He does not forsake you when you are in trouble. (7) He does not roughly despise you.[n.490]Khīṇena nātimaññati. I translate on the supposition thatkhīṇenais an adverb meaning \"hurtfully, roughly\" (see DOP svkhīṇa2).Mp,however, explains the line on the assumption thatkhīṇenameans \"in (time of) loss, when wealth has been exhausted\": \"When one's wealth is exhausted, he does not despise one because of one's loss. He does not think too highly of himself and look down on the other\"(tassa bhoge khīṇe tena khayena taṁ nātimaññati, tasmiṁ omānaṁ attani ca atimānaṁ na karoti). On Mp's interpretation, though, I do not see how this factor would differ from the preceding one.One should associate with a friend who possesses these seven factors.\"",
    "an7.36:2": "A friend gives what is hard to give,and he does what is hard to do.He forgives you your harsh wordsand endures what is hard to endure.",
