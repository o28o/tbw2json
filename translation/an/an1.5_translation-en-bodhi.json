    "an1.5:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other touch that so obsesses the mind of a man as the touch of a woman. The touch of a woman obsesses the mind of a man.\"[n.20]Mp:\"Because of the different inclinations and underlying tendencies of beings, the Buddha mentions each of the (five sense objects) such as forms, saying: ‘I do not see anything like this.’ When a man esteems form, the form of a woman obsesses and impedes him—binds, captivates, deludes, and confuses him; but not so the other sense objects such as sounds. So too, sound but not form captivates one who esteems sound, etc. For some people, only one sense object obsesses the mind; for others, two objects—or three, four, or five objects—obsess them. Thus these five suttas are expounded because of the five kinds of esteem (for different sense objects).\""
