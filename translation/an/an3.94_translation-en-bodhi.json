    "an3.94:1-2": "\"Bhikkhus, just as, in the autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun, ascending in the sky, dispels all darkness from space as it shines and beams and radiates, so too, when the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye arises in the noble disciple, then, together with the arising of vision, the noble disciple abandons three fetters: personal-existence view, doubt, and wrong grasp of behavior and observances.[n.538]Mpexplains thedhammacakkhuwith reference to the commentarial conception of momentary path experiences as the \"eye of the path of stream-entry that comprehends the Dhamma of the four noble truths.\"",
    "an3.94:3": "\"Afterward, when he departs from two states, longing and ill will, then, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. If, bhikkhus, the noble disciple should pass away on that occasion, there is no fetter bound by which he might return to this world.\"[n.59] This phrase normally denotes the attainment of non-returning.Mp,however, identifies this disciple as a \"jhāna non-returner\"(jhānānāgāmī), that is, a stream-enterer or once-returner who also attains jhāna. Though such a practitioner has not yet eliminated the two fetters of sensual desire and ill will, by attaining jhāna he or she is bound to be reborn in the form realm and attain nibbāna there, without taking another rebirth in the sense sphere."
