    "an2.39:1": "\"Bhikkhus, when robbers are strong, kings are weak. At that time the king is not at ease when re-enteringhis capital, or when going out, or when touring the outlying provinces. At that time brahmins and householders, too, are not at ease when re-enteringtheir towns and villages, or when going out, or when attending to work outside."
