    "an1.20:1": "\"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thingon account of which unarisen doubt does not arise and arisen doubt is abandoned so much as careful attention.[n.37] This is an abridgment.SN46.5 verses 5and, says that the \"denourishment\" of doubt occurs \"by giving careful attention to wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blamable and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts.\"For one who attends carefully, unarisen doubt does not arise and arisen doubt is abandoned.\"[n.38]Mp:\"Six other things lead to the abandoning of doubt: much learning, asking questions, skill in the Vinaya, abundant resolve (that is, trust and faith in the Three Jewels), good friendship, and suitable conversation.\""
