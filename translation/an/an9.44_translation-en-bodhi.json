    "an9.44:1": "\"It is said, friend, ‘liberated by wisdom, liberated by wisdom.’ In what way has the Blessed One spoken of one liberated by wisdom?\"[n.958] Again, strictly speaking, according to the formal definition atMN 70.8, I 477,33–36, the one liberated by wisdom(paññāvimutta)is an arahant who does not attain the formless emancipations or the cessation of perception and feeling. Similarly, to meet the formal requirement of \"liberated in both respects\" (in the following sutta), a disciple must not only realize arahantship but must also attain the formless emancipations, as stated atMN 70.7, I 477,25–28.",
    "an9.44:2": "(1) \"Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna … and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a provisional sense.",
    "an9.44:3": "(9) \"Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed; and he understands it with wisdom. To this extent, friend, the Blessed One has spoken of one liberated by wisdom in a non-provisional sense.\""
