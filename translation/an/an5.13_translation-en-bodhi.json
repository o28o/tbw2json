    "an5.13:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. These are the five powers.\"[n.98] These are the five powers(pañca balāni)included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment(bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). These five powers are, as factors, identical with the five faculties(pañc’indriyāni), but the two are distinguished by a difference in aspect. See SN48:43, V 29–20, and its commentary, Spk III 247,2–7, which explains that the faculty of faith means rulership in regard to conviction, and the power of faith means being unshakable in the face of absence of faith(adhimokkhalakkhaṇe indaṭṭhena saddhindriyaṁ, assaddhiye akampanena saddhābalaṁ). Similarly, the other four faculties respectively exercise rulership in regard to exertion, presence, non-distraction, and understanding(paggahaupaṭṭhāna-avikkhepa-pajānana)and the other four powers remain unshakable in the face of laziness, muddle-mindedness, distraction, and ignorance(kosajja-muṭṭhasacca-vikkhepa-avijjā)."
