    "an4.24:1": "Thus have I heard.[n.660]Cehas this in brackets. Be and Ee do not have it at all.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa, at Kāḷaka's Park.[n.66] According toMp,Kāḷaka was a wealthy financier and the fatherin-law of Anāthapiṇḍika's daughter Cūḷasubhaddā. At the time of her marriage, he had been a devotee of the naked ascetics and knew nothing about the Buddha or his teaching. Cūḷasubhaddā contrived to get him to invite the Buddha and the monks for a meal offering. After the meal, the Buddha gave a discourse that established him in the fruit of stream-entry. Kāḷaka then built a monastery in his park and donated both monastery and park to the Buddha. One day, when the bhikkhus who were natives of Sāketa were sitting in the meeting hall discussing the Buddha’s success in converting Kāḷaka, the Buddha read their minds and knew they were ready for a discourse that would settle them in arahantship. It would also cause the great earth to quake up to its boundaries. Hence he addressed the bhikkhus.There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "an4.24:2": "\"Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—that I know.",
    "an4.24:3": "\"Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—that I have directly known. It has been known by the Tathāgata,[n.662]Mp:\"By these three terms(jānāmi,abbhaññāsiṁ,viditaṁ)the plane of omniscience(sabbaññutabhūmi)is indicated.\" In the history of Buddhism, as well as in modern scholarship, the question whether the Buddha claimed omniscience has been a subject of debate. The Buddha certainly rejected the claim that one could know everything all the time (seeMN 71.2, I 482,4–18) as well as the claim that one could know everything simultaneously (seeMN 90.5, II 127,28–0). But he also says that to hold that he totally rejects the possibility of omniscience is to misrepresent him (MN 90.5, II 126,1–27,11). Thus it seems to follow that what the Buddha rejected is the possibility of continuous and simultaneous knowledge of everything, but not discrete and intentional knowledge of whatever can be known (which would exclude much of the future, since it is not predetermined).but the Tathāgata did not become subservient to it.[n.66]Taṁ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi.Mp:\"The Tathāgata did not become subservient to any object at the six sense doors, that is, he did not take it up(na upagañchi)through craving or views. For it is said: ‘The Blessed One sees a form with the eye, but he has no desire and lust for it; the Blessed One is fully liberated in mind …. The Blessed One cognizes a phenomenon with the mind, but he has no desire and lust for it; the Blessed One is fully liberated in mind’ (see SN5:22, IV 164–65). By this the plane of arahantship(khīṇāsavabhūmi)is indicated.\"",
    "an4.24:4": "\"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, ‘In this world with its devas … whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—that I do not know,’ that would be a falsehood on my part.",
    "an4.24:5": "\"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, ‘In this world with its devas … whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—that I both know and do not know,’ that too would be just the same.[n.664]Taṁ p’assa tādisameva.Mp:\"That too would just be false speech.\"",
    "an4.24:6": "\"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, ‘In this world with its devas … whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—that I neither know nor do not know,’ that would be a fault on my part.[n.5]Taṁ mam’assa kali.Mp:\"That statement would be a fault of mine. With the above three statements, the plane of truth(saccabhūmi)is indicated.\"",
    "an4.24:7": "(1) \"So, having seen what can be seen, the Tathāgata does not misconceive the seen, does not misconceive the unseen, does not misconceive what can be seen, does not misconceive one who sees.[n.666]Mp:\"He does not misconceive(na maññati)visible form by way of craving, conceit, or views; and so for the other objects. By this passage, the plane of emptiness(suññatābhūmi)is explained.\"(2) Having heard what can be heard, he does not misconceive the heard, does not misconceive the unheard, does not misconceive what can be heard, does not misconceive one who hears. (3) Having sensed what can be sensed, he does not misconceive the sensed, does not misconceive the unsensed, does not misconceive what can be sensed, does not misconceive one who senses. (4) Having cognized what can be cognized, he does not misconceive the cognized, does not misconceive the uncognized, does not misconceive what can be cognized, does not misconceive one who cognizes.",
    "an4.24:8": "Amid those who are self-constrained, the Stable Onewould not posit as categorically true or falseanything seen, heard, or sensed,clung to and considered truth by others.[n.66] I paraphraseMp'sexplanation of this verse: \"He would not take even one claim of the speculative theorists(diṭṭhigatikā)—who are ‘self-constrained’(sayasaṁvutesu)in the sense that they are constrained or blocked by their conceptions—to be categorical or supreme and trust it, believe it, fall back on it as true or false(evaṁ saccaṁ musā vāpi paraṁ uttamaṁ katvā na odaheyya, na saddaheyya, na pattiyāyeyya), thinking: ‘This alone is true and anything else is false.’\" This explanation nicely connects the verse to the prose line, \"the Tathāgata did not become subservient to it.\"",
    "an4.24:9": "Since they have already seen this dart[n.66]Mpidentifies the \"dart\" as the dart of views(diṭṭhisalla). Elsewhere craving is spoken of as the dart, for instance, at MN II 258,27, andSN I 40,7; in still other passages, the dart is sorrow, as atAN5.48,AN5.50.to which people cling and adhere,saying\"I know, I see, it is just so,\"the Tathāgatas cling to nothing."
