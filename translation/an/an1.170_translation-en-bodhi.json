    "an1.170:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings.[n.67] This sutta, unlike those of the preceding vagga, does not includebahuno janassa. All three editions exclude it, though it is hard to see any reason apart from an old recitation or editorial error."
