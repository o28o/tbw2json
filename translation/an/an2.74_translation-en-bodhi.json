    "an2.74:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of happiness. What two? The happiness based on the presence of rapture and the happiness based on the absence of rapture.These are the two kinds of happiness. Of these two kinds of happiness, the happiness based on the absence of rapture is foremost.\"[n.305]Sappītikārammaṇaṁ sukhaṁandnippītikārammaṇaṁ sukhaṁ. It is doubtful that, in the four Nikāyas, the wordārammaṇaever means \"object of consciousness\" in the general sense it has in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries. Its original meaning is closer to \"basis\" or \"support.\" Occasionally, as in SN34:5, III 266, the word designates a \"meditation object.\" Over time, the meaning ofārammaṇamust have broadened from \"object of meditation\" to \"object of consciousness\" in a general sense, but to my knowledge this development occurred after the period when the Nikāyas were compiled."
