    "an10.25:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these tenkasiṇabases.[n.995]Kasiṇāyatanāni. Thekasiṇasare disks representing elements or colors used as objects ofsamādhimeditation. For example, the earthkasiṇais a disk filled with reddish brown clay; the waterkasiṇais a bowl of water; the colorkasiṇasare colored disks. Though the meditator begins with a physical disk, when he can see thekasiṇaclearly with his mind's eye, he discards the physical disk and focuses solely on the mental image. As concentration deepens, another image called the \"counterpart mark\"(paṭibhāganimitta)emerges as an anchor of attention. Vism chaps. 4 and 5 offer a detailed explanation of thekasiṇas. In the Vism system, the spacekasiṇa(which was originally the base of the infinity of space) is replaced by the limited-spacekasiṇa, and the consciousnesskasiṇaby the lightkasiṇa.What ten? One person perceives the earthkasiṇaabove, below, across, nondual, measureless.[n.996] \"Nondual\"(advaya)here refers simply to the presentation of the object and not to an underlying ontological unity.Mpexplains: \"This is said because one [kasiṇa] does not acquire the quality of another. For just as, when one enters the water, there is only water and nothing else in all directions, so too, the earthkasiṇais only the earthkasiṇa. It is unmixed with any otherkasiṇa. The same method applies to the others.\" Onappamāṇa, \"measureless,\" Mp says: \"This is stated by way of measureless pervasion of this or that (object). For pervading it with the mind, one pervades the whole thing; one does not grasp boundaries, thinking: ‘This is its beginning, this is its middle.’\"One person perceives the waterkasiṇa… the firekasiṇa… the airkasiṇa… the bluekasiṇa… the yellowkasiṇa… the redkasiṇa… the whitekasiṇa… the spacekasiṇa… the consciousnesskasiṇaabove, below, across, nondual, measureless. These are the tenkasiṇabases.\""
