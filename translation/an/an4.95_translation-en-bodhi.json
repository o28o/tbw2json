    "an4.95:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? () One who is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others; (2) one who is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare; (3) one who is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; and (4) one who is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others.",
    "an4.95:2": "(1) \"Suppose, bhikkhus, a cremation brand was blazing at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle: it could not be used as timber either in the village or in the forest. Just like this, I say, is the person who is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others.",
    "an4.95:3": "(2) \"Bhikkhus, the person among these who is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare is the more excellent and sublime of thefirsttwo persons. () The person practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others is the more excellent and sublime of thefirstthree persons. (4) The person practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these four persons.",
    "an4.95:4": "Just as from a cow comes milk, from milk curd, from curd butter, from butter ghee, and from ghee cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so the person practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these four persons."
