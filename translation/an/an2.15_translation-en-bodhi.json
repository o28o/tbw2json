    "an2.15:1": "\"Bhikkhus, if, in regard to a particular disciplinary issue,[n.23]Mpmentions the four kinds of disciplinary issues: involving a dispute(vivādādhikaraṇa), involving an accusation(anuvādādhikaraṇa), involving an offense(āpattādhikaraṇa), and involving procedure(kiccādhikaraṇa). These are dealt with in detail at Vin II 88–92. Briefly, an issue involving a dispute arises when monks or nuns dispute about the Dhamma and the Vinaya; an issue involving an accusation arises when they accuse another member of committing a transgression; an issue involving an offense arises when a monk or nun who has committed a transgression seeks rehabilitation; and an issue involving procedure deals with the collective procedures of the Saṅgha. Methods for settling disciplinary issues(adhikaraṇasamatha)are explained atMN 04.2–20, II 247–50. See tooṬhānissaro 2007a: 546–6.the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and the bhikkhu who reproves him do not each thoroughly reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issuewill lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will not dwell at ease. But if the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and the bhikkhu who reproves him each thoroughly reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will not lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will dwell at ease."
