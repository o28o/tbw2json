    "an6.33:1": "\"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: ‘Bhante, there are these six qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What six? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Saṅgha, reverence for the training, reverence for a sense of moral shame, and reverence for moral dread. These six qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’ This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.\"",
    "an6.33:2": "Respectful toward the Teacher,respectful toward the Dhamma,deeply revering the Saṅgha,endowed with moral shame and moral dread:one who is deferential and reverentialcannot fall away, but is close to nibbāna."
