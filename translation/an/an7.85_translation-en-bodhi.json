    "an7.85:1": "\"Bhikkhus, it is through the breaking of seven things that one is a bhikkhu.[n.609] A pun is involved here, evident in the Pāli:bhinnattā bhikkhu hoti. Puns also explain the word derivations in the following suttas, for example,samitattā samaṇo hoti, andbāhitattā brāhmaṇo hoti. These puns are purely \"pedagogical\" and not etymologically cogent.What seven? Personal-existence view is broken; doubt is broken; wrong grasp of behavior and observances is broken; lust is broken; hatred is broken; delusion is broken; conceit is broken. It is through the breaking of these seven things that one is a bhikkhu.\""
