    "dn32:1": "Thus I have heard:[n.]986 This is aparitta(Sinhalesepirit), a set of protective verses (strangely called a ‘ward-rune’ by RD). The purist may be shocked to find this not only in ‘popular Buddhism’ but actually enshrined in the Canon; but Mrs Rhys Davids offers a spirited defence of such things in the introduction to her translation of this Sutta. She quotes the list of canonical parittas, and a similar list also occurs at VM 3.3: the Ratana Sutta (Sn 222ff., Khp 6), Khandha Paritta (AN 4.67), Dhajagga Paritta (SN .3), and Mora Paritta (Ja 59), beside the present Sutta. These are said to be efficacious through ten thousand million world-systems. DA, however, advises the use of the Metta Sutta in the first place, then the Dhajagga and Ratana Suttas. Only if, after a week, these do not work, should the Ātānātiya be resorted to — which would be of no use in the kind of emergency envisaged in the text! But the mention of the Metta Sutta is interesting because the Khandha Sutta (delivered after a monk had died of a snake-bite) enjoins the practice of loving-kindness to all beings as a form of self-protection. Like certain truthful declarations, this can have powerful effects. See Piyadassi Thera,The Book of Protection(BPS 975).A Tibetan version of this Sutta exists, and a fragment of a Sanskrit version has been found in Central Asia, but this differs considerably from the Pali. It is quoted with translation by K. Saha,Buddhism in Central Asia(Calcutta 970), 47-49. This includes a reference to ′Ātānati the much renowned’, and ‘the heart of Ātānāti furthering all acts ...′ as if this were a person, though according to our text and DA, Ātānātā is a town.This Sutta is much used on special occasions in the countries of Theravāda Buddhism. Thus in Thailand it is chanted at the New Year, together with the Mahāsamaya Sutta (DN 20, with which it has much in common) and the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56., the Buddha’s first sermon). The Thai version also includes a non-canonical introductory portion containing verses of homage to twenty-one Buddhas earlier than Vipassi, going right back to Dipankara, under whom the future Buddha Gotama first went forth, and to three even earlier Buddhas before him. See also K.R. Norman,Pali Literature(Wiesbaden 983), 73ff.at one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha on the Vultures' Peak mountain. Then the Four Great Kings,[n.987] Cf. DN 8..with a great army of yakkhas, with a great army of gandhabbas, with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas, with a great army of nāgas,[n.988] See Introduction p. 45. The four groups mentioned are those of their respective followers.having set up a protection over the four quarters,[n.989] Defence of the four quarters is the special charge of the Four Great Kings. We may, however, note by way of contrast the ‘protection of the four quarters’, and the associations of those quarters, in DN 3.having set serried troops at the four directions, having set up a barricade at the four directions, at the end of the night, having lit up the whole of Vultures' Peak with their surpassing beauty, approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. Then of those yakkhas, some, after worshipping the Gracious One, sat down on one side. Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side. Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One, sat down on one side. Some, after announcing their name and family, sat down on one side. Some, while keeping silent, sat down on one side.[n.990] As at DN 4.9 and elsewhere, indicating the various degrees of commitment or otherwise those concerned felt towards the Buddha. In the case of the yakkhas, the position is explained in verse 2.",

Then some yakkhas rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, vanished right there. Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, vanished right there. Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One, vanished right there. Some, after announcing their name and family vanished right there. And some, while keeping silent, vanished right there.The first recital is finished.The Second Section for Recital66Then the Gracious One when that night had passed addressed the monks, saying: \"This night, monks, the Four Great Kings, with a great army of yakkhas, with a great army of gandhabbas, with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas, with a great army of nāgas, having set up a protection over the four quarters, having set serried troops at the four directions, having set up a barricade at the four directions, at the end of the night, having lit up the whole of Vultures' Peak with their surpassing beauty, approached me, and after approaching and worshipping me, they sat down on one side. Then of those yakkhas, monks, some, after worshipping me, sat down on one side. Some exchanged greetings with me, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side. Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to me, sat down on one side. Some, after announcing their name and family, sat down on one side. Some, while keeping silent, sat down on one side.67Then, while sitting on one side, monks, the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to me: 'There are, reverend Sir, some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One. But, reverend Sir, almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Gracious One.\"'What is the reason for that? Because, reverend Sir, the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor, wines, or intoxicants which cause heedlessness. But, reverend Sir, almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures, do not refrain from taking what has not been given, do not refrain from sexual misconduct, do not refrain from false speech, do not refrain from liquors, wines, or intoxicants which cause heedlessness. To them that is neither dear nor appealing.\"'There are, reverend Sir, disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness, who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places, where there is little sound, little noise, which have a lonely atmosphere, lying hidden away from men, which are suitable for seclusion. And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious One, To please then, reverend Sir, may the Gracious One learn this Āṭānāṭiya protection, for the monks', nuns', laymen's, and laywomen's guard, protection, freedom from harm, and comfortable living.'
