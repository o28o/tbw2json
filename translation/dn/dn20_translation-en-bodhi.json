    "dn20:1": "Thus I have heard:[n.564] This is another curious document, doubtless an example of what RD calls ‘a mnemonic doggrel as was found useful in other cases also by the early Buddhists, who had no books, and were compelled to carry their dictionaries and works of reference in their heads.’ A Sanskrit version from Central Asia has been published, with English translation, by E. Waldschmidt in LEBT, pp. 49-62, and there are also Chinese and Tibetan versions, all of which are quite close to the Pali in general. RD considers the poem (if such we can call it) ‘almost unreadable now’, because ‘the long list of strange names awakes no interest.’ That was in 90. Possibly modem readers who know their Tolkien may think otherwise.
