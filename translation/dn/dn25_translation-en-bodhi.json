    "dn25:1": "Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying in Rājagaha at the Vultures' Peak. And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha[n.759] His name means 'Banyan' . Cf. DN 8.23.was staying at the Udumbarikā lodging[n.760] A park given by Queen Udumbarikā for wanderers, similar to that mentioned atn.746.for wanderers, with a large company of some three thousand wanderers. And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rājagaha in order to see the Lord. Then he thought: 'It is not the proper time to see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat; it is not the proper time to see the meditating monks, they are in retreat. Perhaps I should go to the Udumbarikā lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha.' And he did so.",
    "dn25:2": "And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation[n.761] Cf. DN 1.1.17, and DN 9.3.about kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.",
    "dn25:3": "Then Nigrodha saw Sandhāna approaching from a distance, and he called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't make a noise, gentlemen! The householder Sandhāna, a follower of the ascetic Gotama, is approaching. He is one of the number of white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rājagaha. And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the wanderers fell silent.",
    "dn25:4": "Then Sandhāna approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with him, and then sat down to one side. Then he said: 'Reverend sirs, the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing: they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversation…The Blessed Lord's way is different : he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.'",
    "dn25:5": "Then Nigrodha replied: 'Well now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdom? The ascetic Gotama's wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch. Just as bison[n.762]Go-kaṇṇa.Dictionaries give 'a large species of deer', for which 'bison' seems to be the correct rendering; RD, following DA, has 'a one-eyed cow'.circling around keep to the fringes, so it is with the ascetic Gotama. In fact, householder, if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly, we would baffle him with a single question, we would knock him over like an empty pot.'",
    "dn25:6": "Now the Lord, with his divine-ear-faculty, purified and surpassing human raṅge, heard this exchange between Sandhāna and Nigrodha. And, descending from the Vultures' Peak, he came to the Peacocks' Feeding Ground beside the Sumāgadha Tank, and walked up and down there in the open air. Then Nigrodha caught sight of him, and he called his company to order, saying: 'Gentlemen, he quiet, be less noisy! The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumāgadha Tank. He is fond of quiet, he speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us. If he does so, we will put this question to him: \"Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?\"' At this, the wanderers were silent.",
    "dn25:7": "Then the Lord approached Nigrodha, and Nigrodha said: 'Come, Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.' The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him: 'Nigrodha, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?' Nigrodha replied: 'Lord, we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks' Feeding Ground by the Sumāgadhā Tank, and we thought: \"If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question: Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?\"'",
    "dn25:8": "'Nigrodha, it is hard for you, holding different views, being of different inclinations and subject to different influences, following a different teacher, to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciples… Come on then, Nigrodha, ask me about your own teaching, about your extreme austerity. How are the conditions of austerity and self-mortification fulfilled, and how are they not fulfilled?'",
    "dn25:9": "At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs!'",
    "dn25:10": "Silencing them, Nigrodha said: 'Lord, we teach the higher austerities, we regard them as essential, we adhere to them. Such being the case, what constitutes their fulfilment or non-fulfilment? '",
    "dn25:11": "'Suppose, Nigrodha, a self-mortifier goes naked, uses no polite restraints,In regard to bodily functions (DA).

He does not accept food out of the pot or pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.Thusodakaṁ:'rice-gruel', but the sense requires something fermented.

DN 2.99ff.'Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when, through folly, blindness and evil you spoke thus of me.

It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma.
