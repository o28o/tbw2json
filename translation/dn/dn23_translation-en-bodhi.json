    "dn23:1": "Thus have I heard. Once the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa[n.70] Known as 'Young Kassapa' to distinguish him from other Kassapas, such as Mahā-Kassapa or Kassapa the Great (DN 6.6.9). Described as 'the best preacher in the Saṅgha', he showed his debating skill in this battle of wits with Payasi.was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks, and he came to stay at a town called Setavya. He stayed to the north of Setavya in the Siṁsapā Forest.[n.7] Not the same place as the Simsapa Grove where the Buddha gave the famous parable of the siṁsapā leaves (SN 56.3), which was in Kosambi. Cf.n.388.And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.[n.72] A stock phrase, cf.n.4.",
    "dn23:2": "And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion: 'There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.′[n.713] Cf. the views of Ajita Kesakambali (n.111).Meanwhile, the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news: 'The ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks; he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapā Forest; and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about: \"He is learned, experienced, wise, well-informed, a fine speaker, able to give good replies, venerable, an Arahant.\" And it is good to see such Arahants.' And so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers, made for the Simsapā Forest.",
    "dn23:3": "And just then, Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the Simsapa Forest, he asked his steward why.",
    "dn23:4": "The steward said: 'Sir, it is the ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, … and concerning him a good report has been spread about… That is why they are going to see him.' 'Well then, steward, you go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say: \"Gentlemen, Prince Payasi says: 'Please wait, the Prince will come to see the ascetic Kumara-Kassapa.'\" Already this ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and householders of Setavya that there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds. But no such things exist.' 'Very good, sir', said the steward, and delivered the message.",
    "dn23:5": "Then Prince Payasi, accompanied by the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable Kumara Kassapa, he sat down to one side. And some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa and then sat down to one side, while some first exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some silently sat down to one side.",
    "dn23:6": "Then Price Payasi said to the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa: 'Reverend Kassapa, I hold to this tenet and this view: There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.' 'Well, Prince, I have never seen or heard of such a tenet or view as you declare.",
    "dn23:7": "And so, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. What do you think, Prince? Are the sun and the moon in this world or another, are they gods or humans?'",
    "dn23:8": "'Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world…' ′Have you any reasons for this assertion, Prince?' 'I have, Reverend Kassapa.' ′How is that, Prince?'",
    "dn23:9": "'As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. What do you think, Prince? Suppose they were to bring a thief before you caught in the act, and say: \"This man, Lord, is a thief caught in the act. Sentence him to any punishment you wish.\" And you might say: \"Bind this man's arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.\" And they, saying: \"Very good\" in assent, might… lead him out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.\" Now if that thief were to say to the executioners: \"Good executioners, in this town or village I have friends, colleagues and blood-relations, please wait till I have visited them\", would he get his wish? Or would they just cut off that talkative thief's head?' ′He would not get his wish, Reverend Kassapa. They would just cut off his head.'",
    "dn23:10": "'Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world…' ′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?' 'I have, Reverend Kassapa.' 'What is that, Prince?'",
    "dn23:11": "'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. Suppose a man had fallen head first into a cesspit, and you were to say to your men: \"Pull that man out of the cesspit! \" and they would say: \"Very good\", and do so. Then you would tell them to clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapers, and then to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam. Then you would tell them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times with fine soap-powder. Then you would tell them to dress his hair and beard, and to adorn him with fine garlands, ointments and clothes. Finally you would tell them to lead him up to your palace and let him indulge in the pleasures of the five senses, and they would do so.",
    "dn23:12": "What do you think, Prince? Would that man, having been well washed, with his hair and beard dressed, adorned and garlanded, clothed in white, and having been conveyed up to the palace, enjoying and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses, want to be plunged once more into that cesspit?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa.' 'Why not?' 'Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so, evil-smelling, horrible, revolting, and generally considered to be so.'",
    "dn23:13": "'Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world…' 'Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?' 'I have, Reverend Kassapa.' 'What is that, Prince?'",
    "dn23:14": "'As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall answer as you think fit. That which is for human beings, Prince, a hundred years is for the Thirty-Three Gods one day and night. Thirty of such nights make a month, twelve such months a year, and a thousand such years are the life-span of the Thirty-Three Gods. Now suppose they were to think: \"After we have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses for two or three days we will go to Pāyāsi and tell him there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds\", would they have done so?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa, because we should be long-since dead. But, Reverend Kassapa, who has told you that the Thirty-Three Gods exist, and that they are so long-lived? I don't believe the Thirty-Three Gods exist or are so long-lived.'",
    "dn23:15": "'Prince, imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see dark or light objects, or blue, yellow, red or crimson ones, could not see the smooth and the rough, could not see the stars and the moon. He might say: \"There are no dark and light objects and nobody who can see them, … there is no sun or moon, and nobody who can see them. I am not aware of this thing, and therefore it does not exist.\" Would he be speaking rightly, Prince?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa. There are dark and light objects …, there is a sun and a moon, and anyone who said: \"I am not aware of this thing, I cannot see it, and therefore it does not exist\" would not be speaking rightly.'",
    "dn23:16": "'Well, Prince, it appears that your reply is like that of the blind man when you ask how I know about the Thirty-Three Gods and their longevity. Prince, the other world cannot be seen the way you think, with the physical eye. Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who seek in the jungle-thickets and the recesses of the forest for a resting-place that is quiet, with little noise — they stay there unwearied, ardent, restrained, purifying the divine eye,[n.715] Cf.MN 133,140.and with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human sight, they see both this world and the next, and spontaneously born beings. That, Prince, is how the other world can be seen, and not the way you think, with the physical eye. Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds.'",
    "dn23:17": "'Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is no other world…' 'Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?' 'I have, Reverend Kassapa.' 'What is that, Prince?'",
    "dn23:18": "'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. Once upon a time, Prince, a certain Brahmin had two wives. One had a son ten or twelve years old, while the other was pregnant and nearing her time when the Brahmin died. Then this youth said to his mother's co-wife: \"Lady, whatever wealth and possessions, silver or gold, there may be, is all mine. My father made me his heir.\" At this the Brahmin lady said to the youth: \"Wait, young man, until I give birth. If the child is a boy, one portion will be his, and if it is a girl, she will become your servant.\" The youth repeated his words a second time, and received the same reply. When he repeated them a third time, the lady took a knife and, going into an inner room, cut open her belly, thinking: \"If only I could find out whether it is a boy or a girl!\" And thus she destroyed herself and the living embryo, and the wealth as well, just as fools do who seek their inheritance unwisely, heedless of hidden danger.",
    "dn23:19": "'In the same way you, Prince, will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world, just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritance. But, Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are well-conducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe, but rather they wisely await its ripening. Their life is profitable to those ascetics and Brahmins, for the longer such moral and well-conducted ascetics and Brahmins remain alive, the greater the merit that they create; they practise for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the profit and benefit of devas and humans. Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world…'",

    "dn23:21": "'As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. Do you admit that when you have gone for your midday rest you have seen pleasant visions of parks, forests, delightful country and lotus-ponds?' ′I do, Reverend Kassapa.' 'And at that time are you not watched over by hunchbacks, dwarfs, young girls and maidens?' 'I am, Reverend Kassapa.' 'And do they observe your soul entering or leaving your body?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa.' 'So they do not see your soul entering or leaving your body even when you are alive. Therefore how could you see the soul of a dead man entering or leaving his body? Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world…'",

And suppose that after a time, when it had grown cold and gone out, he weighed it again. At which time would it be lighter, softer and more flexible: when it was hot, burning and glowing, or when it was cold and extinguished?' 'Reverend Kassapa, when that ball of iron is hot, burning and glowing with the elements of fire and air, then it is lighter, softer and more flexible. When, without those elements,[n.718] Of course the elements have not completely vanished, as all four elements are always present. But they have ceased to predominate.it has grown cold and gone out, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible.' 'Well then, Prince, it is just the same with the body. When it has life, heat and consciousness, it is lighter, softer and more flexible. But when it is deprived of life, heat and consciousness, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible. In the same way, Prince, you should consider: \"There is another world…′′′",

    "dn23:25": "'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable… Once there was a trumpeter who took his trumpet[n.721]Sanka:a conch-shell trumpet or 'chank'.and went into the border country.[n.722] The border-country folk were regarded as stupid.On coming to a village, he stood in the village centre, blew his trumpet three times and then, putting it down on the ground, sat down to one side. Then, Prince, those border folk thought: \"Where does that sound come from that is so delightful, so sweet, so intoxicating, so compelling, so captivating?\" They addressed the trumpeter and asked him about this. \"Friends, this trumpet is where those delightful sounds come from.\" So then they laid the trumpet on its back, crying: \"Speak, mister trumpet, speak!\" But the trumpet never uttered a sound. Then they turned it face downwards,…on its side,… on its other side,… stood it up,… stood it on its head, … thumped it with their fists,… stoned it,… beat it with sticks,… struck it with swords,… shook it this way and that, crying: \"Speak, mister trumpet, speak!\" But the trumpet never uttered a sound. The trumpeter thought: \"What fools these border folk are! How stupidly they search for the sound of the trumpet!\" And as they watched him, he took the trumpet, blew it three times, and went away. And those border folk thought: \"It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes a sound. But when it is not accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes no sound.\"",
    "dn23:26": "'In the same way, Prince, when this body has life, heat and consciousness, then it goes and comes back, stands and sits and lies down, sees things with its eyes, hears with its ears, smells with its nose, tastes with its tongue, feels with its body, and knows mental objects with its mind. But when it has no life, heat or consciousness, it does none of these things. In the same way, Prince, you should consider: \"There is another world…′′′",

    "dn23:28": "'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable… Once there was a matted-haired fire-worshipper[n.723] Jaṭila. Soon after his enlightenment, the Buddha had converted the three Kassapa brothers who were fire-worshippers.who dwelt in the forest in a leaf-hut. And a certain tribe was on the move, and its leader stayed for one night near the fire-worshipper's dwelling, and then left. So the fire-worshipper thought he would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make use of. He got up early and went to the site, and there he saw a tiny delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back. At the sight he thought: \"It would not be right for me to look on and let a human being die. I had better take this child to my hermitage, take care of him, feed him and bring him up.\" So he did so. When the boy was ten or twelve, the hermit had some business to do in the neighbourhood. So he said to the boy: \"I want to go to the neighbourhood, my son. You look after the fire and don′t let it go out. If it should go out, here is an axe, here are some sticks, here are the fire-sticks, so you can relight the fire and look after it.\" Having thus instructed the boy, the hermit went into the neighbourhood. But the boy, being absorbed in his games, let the fire go out.",
    "dn23:29": "Then he thought: \"Father said: ′… here is an axe … so you can relight the fire and look after it.' Now I'd better do so!\" So he chopped up the fire-sticks with the axe, thinking: \"I expect I'll get a fire this way.\" But he got no fire. He cut the fire-sticks into two, into three, into four, into five, ten, a hundred pieces, he splintered them, he pounded them in a mortar, he winnowed them in a great wind, thinking: \"I expect I'll get a fire this way.\" But he got no fire,",
    "dn23:30": "… and when the hermit came back, having finished his business, he said: \"Son, why have you let the fire go out?\" and the boy told him what had happened. The hermit thought: \"How stupid this boy is, how senseless! What a thoughtless way to try to get a fire!′′ So, while the boy looked on, he took the fire-sticks and rekindled the fire, saying : \"Son, that's the way to rekindle a fire, not the stupid, senseless, thoughtless way you tried to do it!\"",
    "dn23:31": "'Even though you say this, Reverend Kassapa, still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my opinions, and so do kings abroad. If I give it up, they will say: ′′What a fool Prince Pāyāsi is, how stupidly he grasps at wrong views!\" I will stick to this view out of anger, contempt and spite!'",

And wherever they went, they rapidly consumed all the grass, wood and greenstuff. Now this caravan had two leaders, each wood and water. Throw away the grass, wood and water you have already got, sir! You will make rapid progress with lightly-laden carts, so do not tire your draught-oxen!\"",

But at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, wood or water, nor at the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh, and thus they all came to ruin and destruction. And whatever there was of them, men and cattle, they were all gobbled up by that yakkha-spirit,[n.724] Here the yakkha is definitely evil, but cf.n.503.and only their bones remained.[n.725] The story is also told in Jataka 1, and a related one in Jataka 2 (see I.B. Homer,Ten Jataka Stories,Bangkok 1974).",
    "dn23:34": "'And when the leader of the second caravan was sure the first caravan had gone forward far enough, he stocked up with plenty of grass, wood and water. After two or three days' journey this leader saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him… who advised him to throw away his stocks of grass, wood and water.",
    "dn23:35": "Then the leader said to the carters: \"This man told us that we should throw away the grass, wood and water we already have. But he is not one of our friends and relatives, so why should we trust him? So do not throw away the grass, wood and water we have; let the caravan continue on its way with the goods we have brought, and do not throw any of them away!\" The carters agreed and did as he said. And at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, wood or water, nor at the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh, but there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction, and they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkha-spirit.",

So now let us leave behind such of our goods as are of little value, and take whatever is of greater value from the other caravan.\" And they did so.

But on his way back there was a heavy shower of unseasonable rain, and he went on his way bespattered with oozing, dripping dung to his finger-tips, and still carrying his load of dung.

'Yes, Lord, I am the one who used to say that, but I was converted from that evil view by the Noble Kumāra-Kassapa.' 'And where has the young Brahmin Uttarā, who was in charge of the distribution of your charity, been reborn? '",
    "dn23:56": "And so the Venerable Gavampati, on his return to earth, declared: 'You should give ungrudgingly, with your own hands, with proper concern, not carelessly. Prince Pāyāsi did not do this, and at death, at the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serīsaka mansion, whereas the administrator of his charity, the young Brahmin Uttarā, who gave ungrudgingly, with his own hands, with proper concern and not carelessly, was reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods.'"
