    "dn28:1": "Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying at Nālandā in Pāvārika's mango-grove. And the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said:[n.856] The first two verses are the same as DN 6..6ff, and the rest of the Sutta is a (doubtless later) expansion of that conversation.'It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.'",
    "dn28:2": "'You have spoken boldly with a bull's voice, Sāriputta, you have roared the lion's roar of certainty. How is this? Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of all those Lords open to you, so as to say: \"These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, such their wisdom, such their way, such their liberation\"?' 'No, Lord.'",
    "dn28:3": "'And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future?' 'No, Lord.'",
    "dn28:4": "'Well then, Sāriputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you know: \"The Lord is of such virtue, such his teaching, such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation\"?' 'No, Lord.'",

    "dn28:6": "'Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and present are not open to me. But I know the drift of the Dhamma. Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, at which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind which weaken understanding, having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.",
