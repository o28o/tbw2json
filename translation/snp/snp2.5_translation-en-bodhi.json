    "snp2.5:270": "270“What is the source of lust and hatred?\nWhere are born discontent, delight, and hair-raising terror?\nHaving originated from what do the mind’s thoughts\ntoss one around as boys toss up a crow?”Most editions of Sn and SN 10.3, as well as their commentaries, read: kumārakā dhaṅkam iv’ ossajanti. A variant vaṅkam is found in several manuscripts. Anderson and Smith chose vaṅkam for their edition of Sn, but in his edition of Pj II, Smith replaced it with dhaṅkaṃ, which I adopt. Norman discusses the line at GD 211–12. (1)",
    "snp2.5:271": "271“Lust and hatred have their source here;\nfrom this are born discontent, delight, and hair-raising terror.\nHaving originated from this, the mind’s thoughts\ntoss one around as boys toss up a crow. (2) [49]",
    "snp2.5:272": "272Be numbers both the preceding verse and this one 274. However, Pj II (Be) numbers the two verses 274 and 275, and thus at this point the numbering of Pj II (Be) outstrips that of Sn (Be) by one. “Born from affection, arisen from oneself,\nlike the trunk-born shoots of the banyan tree,\nmanifold, attached to sensual pleasures,\nlike a māluvā creeper stretched across the woods. (3)",
    "snp2.5:273": "273“Those who understand their source,\nthey dispel it — listen, O yakkha! —\nthey cross this flood so hard to cross,\nuncrossed before, for no renewed existence.” (4)"
