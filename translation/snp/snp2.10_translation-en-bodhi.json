    "snp2.10:334": "334Heedlessness is dust always,This pāda, as it has come down in Ee, is missing three syllables. Both Be and Ce duplicate a word, pamādo rajo pamādo. In the parallel, Theragatha 404, Ce reads pamādo rajo sabbadā (Be pamādo rajo pamādo; Ee pamādo rajo). Pj II does not cite a lemma, but its comment, na hi kadāci pamādo nāma arajo atthi, may have been based on an original that had sabbadā. I translate on the assumption sabbadā should be added to the line.\ndust follows upon heedlessness.\nBy heedfulness, by clear knowledge,\ndraw out the dart from oneself. (4)"
