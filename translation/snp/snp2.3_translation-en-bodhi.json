    "snp2.3:253": "253One flouting moral shame, despising it,\nwho says, “I am your friend,”\nbut does not do what can be done:\none should know of him: “He is not my [friend].”In pāda b I read sakhāham with Ce and Ee, as against Be tavāham. On the reading of pāda c, Sayhāni kammāni anādiyantan ti evaṃ bhāsitvāpi ca sayhāni kātuṃ sakkānipi tassa kammāni anādiyantaṃ karaṇatthāya asamādiyantaṃ. Kātuṃ sakkāni is evidently intended as the gloss on sayhāni, but the parallel at Ja III 196,12 has seyyāni kammāni, glossed vacanassa anurūpāni uttamakammāni, “supreme deeds that accord with his words.”. Pāda d needs a word to complete the sense. I adopt “friend” from Pj II. (1)",
    "snp2.3:254": "254The wise understand this one\nwho utters endearing speech to his friends\nwithout following it up [with deeds]\nas one who speaks without acting. (2) [46]",
    "snp2.3:255": "255He is not a friend who is always alert\nin suspecting dissension, observing only one’s fault.\nBut he on whom one relies, like a son on [his father’s] breast,\nwho cannot be divided by others, is truly a friend. (3)",
    "snp2.3:256": "256One develops a state productive of joy,\nhappiness that brings praise,\n[expectant of] its fruit and benefit,\ncarrying out one’s personal duty. (4)",
    "snp2.3:257": "257Having drunk the taste of solitude\nand the taste of tranquil peace,\none is without distress, without evil,\ndrinking the taste of rapture in the Dhamma. (5)"
