    "snp2.3:253": "One flouting moral shame, despising it,who says, “I am your friend,”but does not do what can be done:one should know of him: “He is not my [friend].”In pāda b I readsakhāhamwithCeandEe, as againstBetavāham. On the reading of pāda c,Sayhāni kammāni anādiyantan ti evaṃ bhāsitvāpi ca sayhāni kātuṃ sakkānipi tassa kammāni anādiyantaṃ karaṇatthāya asamādiyantaṃ.Kātuṃ sakkāniis evidently intended as the gloss onsayhāni, but the parallel atJaIII 196,12hasseyyāni kammāni, glossedvacanassa anurūpāni uttamakammāni, “supreme deeds that accord with his words.”. Pāda d needs a word to complete the sense. I adopt “friend” fromPj II.(1)",
