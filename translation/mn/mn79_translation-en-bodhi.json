    "mn79:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludāyin was staying in the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the wanderers’ park, with a large assembly of wanderers.",
    "mn79:2": "Then the Blessed One went to the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the wanderers’ park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludāyin was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talkTiracchānakathā.Many translators render this expression as \"animal talk.\" However,tiracchānameans literally \"going horizontally,\" and though this term is used as a designation for animals, MA explains that in the present context it means talk that goes \"horizontally\" or \"perpendicularly\" to the path leading to heaven and liberation.such as talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells, the dead, trifles, the origin of the world, the origin of the sea, whether things are so or are not so.",
    "mn79:3": "Then the wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Blessed One coming in the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus: \"Sirs, be quiet; sirs, make no noise. Here comes the recluse Gotama. This venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.\" Then the wanderers became silent.",
    "mn79:4": "The Blessed One went to the wanderer Sakuludāyin, who said to him: \"Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir! Welcome to the Blessed One! It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here. Let the Blessed One be seated; this seat is ready.\"",
    "mn79:5": "\"Then, Udāyin, suggest something that I should speak about.\"",
    "mn79:6": "\"Udāyin, if someone should recollect his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births … thus, with their aspects and particulars, should he recollect his manifold past lives, then either he might ask me a question about the past or I might ask him a question about the past, and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his question.",
    "mn79:7": "If someone with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, should see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate … and understand how beings pass on according to their actions, then either he might ask me a question about the future or I might ask him a question about the future, and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his question.",
    "mn79:8": "But let be the past, Udāyin, let be the future. I shall teach you the Dhamma: When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.\"[n.72] This is a statement of the abstract principle of dependent origination exemplified by the twelvefold formula. The abstract principle on cessation is stated atMN 3.24. Ñm had rendered the principle of arising thus: \"That is when this is; that arises with the arising of this.\" And the principle of cessation: \"That is not when this is not; that ceases with the cessation of this.\"",
    "mn79:9": "\"Venerable sir, I cannot even recollect with their aspects and particulars all that I have experienced within this present existence, so how should I recollect my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births … with their aspects and particulars, as the Blessed One does? And I cannot now even see a mud-goblin, so how should I with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate … and understand how beings pass on according to their actions, as the Blessed One does? But, venerable sir, when the Blessed One told me: ‘But let be the past, Udāyin, let be the future. I shall teach you the Dhamma: When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases’ — that is even more unclear to me. Perhaps, venerable sir, I might satisfy the Blessed One's mind by answering a question about our own teachers’ doctrine.\"",
    "mn79:10": "\"Well, Udāyin, what is taught in your own teachers’ doctrine?\"",
    "mn79:11": "\"But, Udāyin, since it is taught in your own teachers’ doctrine: ‘This is the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!’ — what is that perfect splendour?\"",
    "mn79:12": "\"But, Udāyin, what is that splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime?\"",
    "mn79:13": "\"Udāyin, you might continue for a long time in this way. You say: ‘Venerable sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime,’ yet you do not indicate what that splendour is. Suppose a man were to say: ‘I am in love with the most beautiful girl in this country.’ Then they would ask him: ‘Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love — do you know whether she is from the noble class or the brahmin class or the merchant class or the worker class?’ and he would reply: ‘No.’ Then they would ask him: ‘Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love — do you know her name and clan? … Whether she is tall or short or of middle height? … Whether she is dark or brown or golden-skinned? … What village or town or city she lives in?’ and he would reply: ‘No.’ And then they would ask him: ‘Good man, do you then love a girl you have never known or seen?’ and he would reply: ‘Yes.’",

    "mn79:24": "\"But, Udāyin, why do you say that?\"",

We are lost along with our own teachers’ doctrines!

MA explains that they knew that in the past meditators would do the preparatory work on the kasiṇa, attain the third jhāna, and be reborn in the world of Refulgent Glory. But as time went on, the preparatory work on thekasiṇawas no longer understood and meditators were not able to attain the third jhāna. The wanderers only learned that \"an entirely pleasant world\" exists and that the five qualities mentioned at verse 21 were the \"practical way\" to it. They knew of no entirely pleasant world higher than the third jhāna, and of no practical way higher than the five qualities.",

    "mn79:43": "\"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings … Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions.
