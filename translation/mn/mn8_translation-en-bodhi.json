After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:",
    "mn8:2": "\"Cunda, as to those various views that arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world: ifthe objectin relation to which those views arise, which they underlie, and which they are exercised upon[n.104]MAexplains that the word \"arise\"(uppajjanti)refers here to the arising of views that have not arisen before; \"underlie\"(anusenti)to their gathering strength through continued adherence to them; and being \"exercised\"(samudācaanti)to their gaining bodily or verbal expression. The \"object\" upon which they are based is the five aggregates(khandha)that constitute a person or living being — material form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ then the abandoning and relinquishing of those views comes about.[n.105] By this statement the Buddha shows the means by which these views are eradicated: contemplation of the five aggregates as \"not mine,\" etc., with the wisdom of insight culminating in the path of stream-entry.",
    "mn8:3": "\"It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement. ’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.[n.106]MAexplains that the Buddha, having answered the Elder's question, now speaks of another type of overestimator — those who attain the eight meditative attainments and believe that they are practising true effacement(sallekha). The word sallekha, originally meaning austerity or ascetic practice, is used by the Buddha to signify the radical effacing or removal of defilements. Though the eight attainments are elsewhere placed securely within the Buddhist training (seeMN 25.12–19,MN 26.4–41), it is here said that they should not be called effacement because the bhikkhu who attains them does not use them as a basis for insight — as described for example inMN 52andMN 64but only as a means of enjoying bliss and peace.",
    "mn8:4": "\"It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.

    "mn8:5": "\"It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture, some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.",
    "mn8:6": "\"It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.",
    "mn8:7": "\"It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space.
