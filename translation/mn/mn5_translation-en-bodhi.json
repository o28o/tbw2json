    "mn5:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus. \"Friends, bhikkhus.\" — \"Friend,\" they replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:",
    "mn5:2": "\"Friends, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world.[n.69]MA,picking up on the venerable Sāriputta's use of the word \"person\"(puggala), explains that the Buddha has a twofold teaching — a conventional teaching(sammutidesanā)expressed in terms of persons, beings, women, and men, etc.; and an ultimate teaching(paramatthadesanā)expressed solely in terms that possess ultimate ontological validity, such as aggregates, elements, sense bases, impermanent, suffering, not self, etc. The Buddha expounds his teaching through whichever approach is best suited to enable the hearer to penetrate the meaning, dispel delusion, and achieve distinction. The use of the word \"person,\" therefore, does not imply a misconception of the person as a self.What four? Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself.’ Here some person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself.’ Here some person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish in myself.’ Here some person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish in myself.’",
    "mn5:3": "When this was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked the venerable Sāriputta:",
    "mn5:4": "\"Friend Sāriputta, what is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with a blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man? What is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man?\"",
    "mn5:5": "\"Herein, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled. Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it away in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and stained later on?\" — \"Yes, friend.\" — \"So too, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can be expected … that he will die … with mind defiled.",

    "mn5:27": "When this was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said to the venerable Sāriputta: \"A simile occurs to me, friend Sāriputta.\" — \"State it, friend Moggallāna.\" — \"On one occasion, friend, I was living at the Hill Fort at Rājagaha. Then, when it was morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went into Rājagaha for alms. Now on that occasion Samīti the cartwright's son was planing a felloe and the Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta, son of a former cartwright, was standing by.[n.73] The Ājīvakas, or Ājīvikas, were a rival sect whose teaching emphasised severe austerities based on a philosophy bordering on fatalism. See Basham,History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas.Then this thought arose in the Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta's mind: ‘Oh that this Samīti the cartwright's son might plane this bend, this twist, this fault, out of the felloe so that it would be without bends, twists, or faults, and come to consist purely of heartwood.’ And just as this thought came to pass in his mind, so did Samīti the cartwright's son plane that bend, that twist, that fault, out of the felloe. Then the Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta, son of a former cartwright, was glad and he voiced his gladness thus: ‘He planes just as if he knew my heart with his heart!’",
    "mn5:28": "\"So too, friend, there are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken, unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted to wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful of training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware, unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers. The venerable Sāriputta with his discourse on the Dhamma planes out their faults just as if he knew my heart with his heart![n.74] The possessive pronouns qualifying heart are not in the Pali, but the sense of the phrase has to be understood by consideration of the simile. Just as Samīti planed the faults out of the felloe as if he knew Paṇḍuputta's heart with his own heart, so does Sāriputta plane out the faults of the bhikkhus as if he knew Moggallāna's wish to have them removed. MLS (1:40) misses the point by translating: \"because he knows their hearts with his heart,\" taking the first reference to be to the monks rather than to Ven. Moggallāna.",
    "mn5:29": "\"But there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, or loose-spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluseship, greatly respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute, established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. These, on hearing the venerable Sāriputta's discourse on the Dhamma, drink it in and eat it, as it were, by word and thought. Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the wholesome."
