    "mn10:1": "Thus have I heard.[n.33] This is one of the most important suttas in the Pali Canon, containing the most comprehensive statement of the most direct way to the attainment of the Buddhist goal. Virtually the identical sutta is found as well atDN22, though with an expanded analysis of the Four Noble Truths attached, which accounts for its greater length. The sutta, its commentary, and copious extracts from its difficult but illuminating subcommentary have been presented together in translation by Soma Thera inThe Way of Mindfulness.A very readable translation of the sutta, with a modern commentary excelling in clarity and depth, will be found in Nyanaponika Thera,The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma.[n.34] This town is said by some scholars to have been in the vicinity of modern Delhi.There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" — \"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this:",
    "mn10:2": "\"Bhikkhus, this is the direct path[n.135] The Pali readsekāyano ayaṁ bhikkhave maggo,and virtually all translators understand this as a statement upholdingsatipatṭ̣hānaas an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: \"This is the only way, O bhikkhus,\" and Ven. Nyanaponika: \"This is the sole way, monks.\" Ñm, however, points out that ekāyana magga atMN1.37–4has the unambiguous contextual meaning of \"a path that goes in one way only,\" and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The expression used here, \"the direct path,\" is an attempt to preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explainsekāyana maggaas a single path, not a divided path; as a way that has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way that goes to one goal, Nibbāna. Though there is neither canonical nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained thatsatipaṭṭhānais calledekāyana magga,the direct path, to distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that proceeds through the jhānas orbrahmavihāras.While the latter can lead to Nibbāna, they do not do so necessarily but can lead to sidetracks, whereassatipaṭṭhānaleads invariably to the final goal.for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna — namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.[n.136] The wordsatipaṭṭhānais a compound term. The first part, sati, originally meant \"memory,\" but in Pali Buddhist usage it far more frequently bears the meaning of attentiveness directed to the present — hence the makeshift rendering \"mindfulness.\" The second part is explained in two ways: either as a shortened form ofupaṭṭhāna,meaning \"setting up\" or \"establishing\" — here, of mindfulness; or aspaṭṭhāna,meaning \"domain\" or \"foundation\" — again, of mindfulness. Thus the foursatipaṭṭhānasmay be understood as either the four ways of setting up mindfulness or as the four objective domains of mindfulness, to be amplified in the rest of the sutta. The former seems to be the etymologically correct derivation (confirmed by the Sanskritsmṛtyupasthāna), but the Pali commentators, while admitting both explanations, have a predilection for the latter.",
    "mn10:3": "\"What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu[n.17]MAsays that in this context, \"bhikkhu\" is a term indicating a person who earnestly endeavours to accomplish the practice of the teaching: \"Whoever undertakes that practice … is here comprised under the term ‘bhikkhu.’\"abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.[n.18] The repetition in the phrase \"contemplating the body as a body\"(kāye kāyānupassī), according toMA,has the purpose of precisely determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that object from others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice, the body should be contemplated as such, and not one's feelings, ideas, and emotions concerning it. The phrase also means that the body should be contemplated simply as a body and not as a man, a woman, a self, or a living being. Similar considerations apply to the repetitions in the case of each of the other three foundations of mindfulness. \"Covetousness and grief,\" MA says, stands for sensual desire and ill will, the principal hindrances that must be overcome for the practice to succeed, enumerated separately below in verse 6.He abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.[n.19] The structure of this sutta is fairly simple. Following the preamble, the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of the four foundations of mindfulness:I. Contemplation of the body, which comprises fourteen exercises: mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the four postures; full awareness; attention to foulness; attention to the elements; and nine \"charnel ground contemplations\" — reflection on corpses in different stages of decomposition.II. Contemplation of feeling, considered one exercise.III. Contemplation of mind, also one exercise.IV. Contemplation of mind-objects, which has five subdivisions — the five hindrances; the five aggregates; the six sense bases; the seven enlightenment factors; and the Four Noble Truths.Thus the sutta expounds altogether twenty-one exercises in contemplation. Each exercise in turn has two aspects: the basic exercise, explained first, and a supplementary section on insight (essentially the same for all the exercises), which indicates how the contemplation is to be developed to deepen understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.Finally the sutta concludes with a statement of assurance in which the Buddha personally vouches for the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of continuous practice to be either arahantship or non-returning.",
    "mn10:4": "\"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’[n.10] The practice of mindfulness of breathing(ānāpānasati)involves no deliberate attempt to regulate the breath, as in hatha yoga, but a sustained effort to fix awareness on the breath as it moves in and out in its natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at the nostrils or the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt most distinctly; the length of the breath is noted but not consciously controlled. The complete development of this meditation method is expounded inMN 118. For a collection of texts on this subject, see Bhikkhu Ñāṅamoli,Mindfulness of Breathing.See too Vsm VIII, 15–2.",
    "mn10:5": "He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’[n.141]MAexplains \"experiencing the whole body\"(sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī )as signifying that the meditator becomes aware of each in-breath and out-breath through its three phases of beginning, middle, and end. In the first edition I followed this explanation and added in brackets \"of breath\" after \"the whole body.\" In retrospect, however, this interpretation seems forced, and I now prefer to take the phrase quite literally. It is also difficult to see howpaṭisamivedicould mean \"is aware of,\" as it is based on a verb meaning \"to experience.\"",
    "mn10:6": "He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the mation’ ; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’[n.142] The \"bodily formation\"(kāyasaṅkhāra)is defined atMN 44.13as in-and-out breathing itself. Thus, as MA explains, with the successful development of the practice, the meditator's breathing becomes increasingly quiet, tranquil, and peaceful.",
    "mn10:7": "Just as a skilled lathe-operator or his apprentice, when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’; or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I breathe in long’ … he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’",
    "mn10:8": "\"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally.[n.143]MA:\"Internally\": contemplating the breathing in his own body. \"Externally\": contemplating the breathing occurring in the body of another. \"Internally and externally\": contemplating the breathing in his own body and in the body of another alternately, with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to the refrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under the contemplation of feeling, mind, and mind-objects, the contemplation externally, apart from those possessing telepathic powers, must be inferential.Or else he abides contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of vanishing, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of both arising and vanishing.[n.144] The expressionsamudayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṁ viharatiis usually translated \"he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors\" (as was done in the first edition), on the assumption that the compound contains a plural,samudayadhammā.A plural sense, however, is not mandatory, and it is more consistent with the use of the suffix -dhamma elsewhere to take it to mean \"subject to\" or \"having the nature of\" here as well. The commentarial explanation of the conditioning factors for each of the four foundations does not imply that the commentary understands-dhammato mean the actual conditioning factors.MAexplains that the arising nature(samudayadhamma)of the body can be observed in its conditioned origination through ignorance, craving, kamma, and food, as well as in the moment-by-moment origination of material phenomena in the body. In the case of mindfulness of breathing, an additional condition is the physiological apparatus of respiration. The \"vanishing nature\"(vayadhamma )of the body is seen in the cessation of bodily phenomena through the cessation of their conditions as well as in the momentary dissolution of bodily phenomena.Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness.[n.145]MA:For the sake of a wider and wider and higher and higher measure of knowledge and mindfulness.And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.

    "mn10:73–78": "\"There being the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor in him[n.162] \"Investigation of states\"(dhammavicaya)means the scrutiny of the mental and physical phenomena presented to the meditator's mind by mindfulness.… There being the energy enlightenment factor in him … There being the rapture enlightenment factor in him … There being the tranquillity enlightenment factor in him … There being the concentration enlightenment factor in him … There being the equanimity enlightenment factor in him, a bhikkhu understands: ‘There is the equanimity enlightenment factor in me’; or there being no equanimity enlightenment factor in him, he understands: ‘There is no equanimity enlightenment factor in me’; and he also understands how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor, and how the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor comes to fulfilment by development.[n.163] The commentaries explain in detail the conditions that conduce to the maturation of the enlightenment factors. SeeThe Way of Mindfulness,pp. 134–149.",
    "mn10:79": "\"In this way he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in terms of the seven enlightenment factors.",
    "mn10:80": "\"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in terms of the Four Noble Truths.[n.164] With this section, the contemplation ofdhammāculminates in the understanding oftheDhamma in its core formulation as the Four Noble Truths. The longer Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya gives extended definitions and elaborations of each of the truths.And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in terms of the Four Noble Truths? Here a bhikkhu understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’",
    "mn10:128": "\"In this way he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects internally, or he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects externally, or he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects both internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating in mind-objects their nature of arising, or he abides contemplating in mind-objects their nature of vanishing, or he abides contemplating in mind-objects their nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there are mind-objects’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in terms of the Four Noble Truths.",
    "mn10:129": "\"Bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left, non-return.[n.165] Final knowledge,aññā,is the arahant's knowledge of final deliverance. Non-return(anāgāmitā)is, of course, the state of a non-returner, who is reborn in a higher world where he attains final Nibbāna without ever returning to the human world.",
    "mn10:130": "\"Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years … for five years … for four years … for three years … for two years … for one year, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left, non-return.",
    "mn10:131": "\"So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘Bhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna — namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.’\"",
    "mn10:132": "That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words."
