    "mn95:1": "Thus have I heard.[n.880] The opening passage of this sutta, down to ¶24, is virtually identical with the opening of the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta (DN 4).On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Opasāda. There the Blessed One stayed in the Gods’ Grove,[n.88]MA: It was called thus because offerings were made there to the gods.the Sāla-tree Grove to the north of Opasāda.",
    "mn95:2": "Then the brahmin householders of Opasāda set forth from Opasāda in groups and bands and headed northwards to the Gods’hmin Cankī, together wi Grove, the Sāla-tree Grove.",
    "mn95:3": "Now on that occasion five hundred brahmins from various states were staying at Opasāda for some business or other. They heard: \"The brahmin Caṅkī, it is said, is going to see the recluse Gotama.\" Then they went to the brahmin Caṅkī and asked him: \"Sir, is it true that you are going to see the recluse Gotama?\"",
    "mn95:4": "When this was said, the brahmin Cankī told those brahmins: “Now, sirs, hear from me why it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama, and why it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me.",
    "mn95:5": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth abandoning much gold and bullion stored away in vaults and in lofts.",
    "mn95:6": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from the home life into homelessness while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life.",
    "mn95:7": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama shaved off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness though his mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces.",
    "mn95:8": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion, with sublime beauty and sublime presence, remarkable to behold.",
    "mn95:9": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is virtuous, with noble virtue, with wholesome virtue, possessing wholesome virtue.",
    "mn95:10": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a good speaker with a good delivery; he speaks words that are courteous, distinct, flawless, and communicate the meaning.",
    "mn95:11": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a teacher of the teachers of many.",
    "mn95:12": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is free from sensual lust and without personal vanity.",
    "mn95:13": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama holds the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action, the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deeds; he does not seek any harm for the line of brahmins.",
    "mn95:14": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from an aristocratic family, from one of the original noble families.",
    "mn95:15": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from a rich family, from a family of great wealth and great possessions.",
    "mn95:16": "Sirs, people come from remote kingdoms and remote districts to question the recluse Gotama.",
    "mn95:17": "Sirs, many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama.",
    "mn95:18": "Sirs, a good report of the recluse Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’",
    "mn95:19": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.",
    "mn95:20": "Sirs, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama.",
    "mn95:21": "Sirs, King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama.",
    "mn95:22": "Sirs, the brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama.",
    "mn95:23": "Sirs, the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasāda and is living at Opasāda in the Gods’ Grove, the Sāla-tree Grove to the north of Opasāda. Now any recluses or brahmins that come to our town are our guests, and guests should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by us. Since the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasāda, he is our guest, and as our guest should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by us. Since this is so, sirs, it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me; rather, it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama.",
    "mn95:24": "Then the brahmin Caṅkī, together with a large company of brahmins, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side.",
    "mn95:25": "Then the brahmin student Kāpaṭhika thought: \"The recluse Gotama has turned towards me. Suppose I ask him a question.\" Then he said to the Blessed One: \"Master Gotama, in regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission, preserved in the collections, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: ‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ What does Master Gotama say about this?\"",
    "mn95:26": "\"So, Bhāradvāja, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single brahmin who says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teacher's teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers, who says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ And the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns … even these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus: ‘We know this, we see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’",
    "mn95:27": "Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. So too, Bhāradvāja, in regard to their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. What do you think, Bhāradvāja, that being so, does not the faith of the brahmins turn out to be groundless?\"",
    "mn95:28": "\"But, Master Gotama, in what way is there the preservation of truth?[n.886]Saccānurakkhana:or, the safeguarding of truth, the protection of truth.How does one preserve truth? We ask Master Gotama about the preservation of truth.\"",

    "mn95:30": "\"When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from states based on greed, he next investigates him in regard to states based on hate: ‘Are there in this venerable one any states based on hate such that, with his mind obsessed by those states … he might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘There are no such states based on hate in this venerable one. The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not those of one affected by hate. And the Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound … to be experienced by the wise.

This stage thus seems to be that of insight contemplation.having scrutinised, he strives;[n.890] Although applying the will(ussahati)appears similar to striving(padahati), the former may be understood as the exertion undertaken prior to insight contemplation, the latter as the exertion that brings insight up to the level of the supramundane path.resolutely striving, he realises with the body the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.[n.891]MA: He realises Nibbāna with the mental bodyof the path of stream-entry, and having penetrated the defilements, he sees Nibbāna with wisdom, making it clear and evident.In this way, Bhāradvāja, there is the discovery of truth; in this way one discovers truth; in this way we describe the discovery of truth.
