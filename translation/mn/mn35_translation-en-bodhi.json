    "mn35:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesālī in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.",
    "mn35:2": "Then, when it was morning, the venerable Assaji dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesālī for alms.[n.370] Ven. Assaji was one of the first five disciples of the Buddha.As Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son was walking and wandering for exercise in Vesālī, he saw the venerable Assaji coming in the distance and went up to him and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son stood at one side and said to him:",
    "mn35:3": "Now at that time five hundred Licchavis had met together in an assembly hall for some business or other. Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son went to them and said: \"Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth! Today there will be some conversation between me and the recluse Gotama. If the recluse Gotama maintains before me what was maintained before me by one of his famous disciples, the bhikkhu named Assaji, then just as a strong man might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag him to and drag him fro and drag him round about, so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as a strong brewer's workman might throw a big brewer's sieve into a deep water tank, and taking it by the corners, drag it to and drag it fro and drag it round about, so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as a strong brewer's mixer might take a strainer by the corners and shake it down and shake it up and thump it about, so in debate I will shake the recluse Gotama down and shake him up and thump him about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant might plunge into a deep pond and enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing with the recluse Gotama.[n.72]MAexplains that men play this game when preparing hemp cloth. They bind up handfuls of rough hemp, immerse them in the water, and beat them on planks to the left, right, and middle. A royal elephant saw this game, and plunging into the water, he took up water in his trunk and sprayed it on his belly, his body, both sides, and his groin.Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth! Today there will be some conversation between me and the recluse Gotama.\"",
    "mn35:4": "Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open. Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son went up to them and asked: \"Where is Master Gotama staying now, sirs? We want to see Master Gotama.\"",
    "mn35:5": "When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son had sat down, he said to the Blessed One: \"I would like to question Master Gotama on a certain point, if Master Gotama would grant me the favour of an answer to the question.\"",
    "mn35:6": "\"A simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.\"",
    "mn35:7": "\"Just as when seeds and plants, whatever their kind, reach growth, increase, and maturation, all do so in dependence upon the earth, based upon the earth; and just as when strenuous works, whatever their kind, are done, all are done in dependence upon the earth, based upon the earth — so too, Master Gotama, a person has material form as self, and based upon material form he produces merit or demerit. A person has feeling as self, and based upon feeling he produces merit or demerit. A person has perception as self, and based upon perception he produces merit or demerit. A person has formations as self, and based upon formations he produces merit or demerit. A person has consciousness as self, and based upon consciousness he produces merit or demerit.\"",
    "mn35:8": "\"Aggivessana, are you not asserting thus: ‘Material form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, formations are my self, consciousness is my self’?\"",
    "mn35:9": "\"What has this great multitude to do with you, Aggivessana? Please confine yourself to your own assertion alone.\"",
    "mn35:10": "\"In that case, Aggivessana, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer it as you choose. What do you think, Aggivessana? Would a head-anointed noble king — for example, King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha — exercise the power in his own realm to execute those who should be executed, to fine those who should be fined, and to banish those who should be banished?\"",
    "mn35:11": "\"What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Material form is my self,’ do you exercise any such power over that material form as to say: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus’?\"[n.374] The Buddha is here suggesting that the aggregates are not self because they lack one of the essential characteristics of selfhood — being susceptible to the exercise of mastery. What cannot come under my mastery or perfect control cannot be identified as \"my self.\"When this was said, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son was silent.",
    "mn35:12": "Now on that occasion a thunderbolt-wielding spirit holding an iron thunderbolt that burned, blazed, and glowed, appeared in the air above Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son, thinking: \"If this Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son, when asked a reasonable question up to the third time by the Blessed One, still does not answer, I shall split his head into seven pieces here and now.\"[n.375]MAidentifies this spirit(yakkha)as Sakka, ruler of the gods.The Blessed One saw the thunderbolt-wielding spirit and so did Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son. Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son was frightened, alarmed, and terrified. Seeking his shelter, asylum, and refuge in the Blessed One himself, he said: \"Ask me, Master Gotama, I will answer.\"",
    "mn35:13": "\"What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Material form is my self,’ do you exercise any such power over that material form as to say: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus’?\" — \"No, Master Gotama.\"",
    "mn35:14": "\"Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you said afterwards does not agree with what you said before, nor does what you said before agree with what you said afterwards. What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Feeling is my self,’ do you exercise any power over that feeling as to say: ‘Let my feeling be thus; let my feeling not be thus’?\" — \"No, Master Gotama.\"",

What do you think, Aggivessana, is material form permanent or impermanent?\" — \"Impermanent, Master Gotama.\" — \"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\" — \"Suffering, Master Gotama.\" — \"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?\" — \"No, Master Gotama.\"",

    "mn35:20": "\"What do you think, Aggivessana? When one adheres to suffering, resorts to suffering, holds to suffering, and regards what is suffering thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self,’ could one ever fully understand suffering oneself or abide with suffering utterly destroyed?\"",
    "mn35:21": "*\"What do you think, Aggivessana? That being so, do you not adhere to suffering, resort to suffering, hold to suffering, and regard what is suffering thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?\"",
    "mn35:22": "\"It is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, were to take a sharp axe and enter the wood, and there he would see a large plantain trunk, straight, young, with no fruit-bud core. Then he would cut it down at the root, cut off the crown, and unroll the leaf-sheaths; but as he went on unrolling the leaf sheaths, he would never come even to any sapwood, let alone heartwood. So too, Aggivessana, when you are pressed, questioned, and cross-questioned by me about your own assertion, you turn out to be empty, vacant, and mistaken. But it was you who made this statement before the Vesālī assembly: ‘I see no recluse or brahmin, the head of an order, the head of a group, the teacher of a group, even one claiming to be accomplished and fully enlightened, who would not shake, shiver, and tremble and sweat under the armpits if he were to engage in debate with me. Even if I were to engage a senseless post in debate, it would shake, shiver, and tremble if it were to engage in debate with me, so what shall I say of a human being?’ Now there are drops of sweat on your forehead and they have soaked through your upper robe and fallen to the ground. But there is no sweat on my body now.\" And the Blessed One uncovered his golden-coloured body before the assembly. When this was said, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response.",
    "mn35:23": "Then Dummukha, the son of the Licchavis, seeing Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son in such a condition, said to the Blessed One: \"A simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.\"",
    "mn35:24": "Then he said: \"Let be, Master Gotama, that talk of ours and of other ordinary recluses and brahmins. It was mere prattle, I think. But in what way is a disciple of the Master Gotama one who carries out his instruction, who responds to his advice, who has crossed beyond doubt, become free from perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation?\"[n.377] These are the characteristics of asekha.The arahant, in contrast, not only possesses the right view of non-self, but has used it to eradicate all clinging, as the Buddha will explain in ¶25.",
    "mn35:25": "\"Master Gotama, in what way is a bhikkhu an arahant with taints destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge?\"",
    "mn35:26": "When this was said, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son replied: \"Master Gotama, we were bold and impudent in thinking we could attack Master Gotama in debate. A man might attack a mad elephant and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a blazing mass of fire and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a terrible poisonous snake and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. We were bold and impudent in thinking we could attack Master Gotama in debate.",
    "mn35:27": "Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son addressed the Licchavis: \"Hear me, Licchavis. The recluse Gotama together with the Saṅgha of good bhikkhus has been invited by me for tomorrow's meal. You may bring to me whatever you think would be suitable for him.\""
