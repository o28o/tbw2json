    "mn102:1": "Thus have I heard.[n.935] This sutta is a \"middle length\" counterpart of the longer Brahmajāla Sutta, included in the Dīgha Nikāya and published in translation with its commentaries in Bodhi,Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views. Detailed explanations for almost all the views mentioned in this sutta will be found in the Introduction and Part Two of that work. There exists a Tibetan translation of the Panācatraya Sūtra, the counterpart of this text belonging to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school, whose collections were preserved in Skt. This text is discussed by Peter Skilling atMahāsūtras II,pp. 469–5. Skilling highlights the interesting contrasts between this version of the text and the Pali version.On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sā̄vatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" — \"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this:",
    "mn102:2": "i\"Therein, bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self, percipient and unimpaired after death, to be either:",
    "mn102:3": "ii\"Therein, bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as non-percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self, non-percipient and unimpaired after death, to be either:",
    "mn102:4": "iii\"Therein, bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor non-percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self, neither percipient nor non-percipient and unimpaired after death, to be either:",
    "mn102:5": "iv\"Therein, bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who describe the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existing beingat death[n.947] The Brahmajāla Sutta explains seven types of annihilationism, here all collected together as one.criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death, and they criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as non-percipient and unimpaired after death, and they criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor non-percipient and unimpaired after death. Why is that? All these good recluses and brahmins, rushing onwards, assert their attachment thus: ‘We shall be thus after death, we shall be thus after death.’ Just as a merchant going to market thinks: ‘Through this, that will be mine; with this, I will get that’; so too, these good recluses and brahmins seem like merchants when they declare: ‘We shall be thus after death, we shall be thus after death.’",
    "mn102:6": "\"Bhikkhus, any recluses or brahmins who speculate about the future and hold views about the future, who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the future, all assert these five bases or a certain one among them.[n.949] So far only four of the original five classes of speculations about the future have been analysed, yet the Buddha speaks as if they were all explicated. MA tries to resolve the problem by explaining that assertions of \"Nibbāna here and now\" were comprised by the terms \"percipient of unity\" and \"percipient of diversity\" in ¶2. This explanation, however, is not convincing. Ñm, in Ms, had added the heading \"Nibbāna Here and Now\" over ¶10, and the following paragraphs do seem to correspond with the last four of the five doctrines of Nibbāna here and now in the Brahmajāla Sutta. However, this interpretation seems contradicted by ¶ and by the phrase used in ¶p10–13, \"with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future,\" which would exclude the doctrines of Nibbāna here and now from views about the future (though it is placed among such views in the preamble). The problem seems insoluble, and raises the suspicion that the text was to some degree corrupted in the course of its oral transmission. The insertion of the views about the past just below is also problematic. Not only are such views not mentioned in the preamble, but the placing of the past after the future inverts the normal time sequence. Skilling suggests this passage may have been part of an oral commentary on the sutta which, at some point, was absorbed into the text.",
    "mn102:7": "\"Bhikkhus, there are some recluses and brahmins who speculate about the past and hold views about the past, who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the past.",
    "mn102:8": "(1) \"Therein, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘The self and the world are eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong,’ that apart from faith, apart from approval, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned cogitation, apart from reflective acceptance of a view, they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this — that is impossible.[n.956] That is, they must accept their doctrine on some ground other than knowledge, one involving belief or reasoning. AtMN 95.14, it is said that these five grounds of conviction yield conclusions that can turn out to be either true or false.Since they have no pure and clear personal knowledge, even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarifyabout their viewis declared to be clinging on their part.[n.957]MA: That is not really knowledge but wrong understanding; thus it is declared to be clinging to views.That is conditioned and gross, but there is cessation of formations.

    "mn102:9": "(2–16) \"Therein, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘The self and the world are not eternal … both eternal and not eternal … neither eternal nor not eternal … finite … infinite … both finite and infinite … neither finite nor infinite … percipient of unity … percipient of diversity … percipient of the limited … percipient of the immeasurable …experienceexclusively pleasure …experienceexclusively pain …experienceboth pleasure and pain …experienceneither pleasure nor pain: only this is true, anything else is wrong,’ that apart from faith, apart from approval, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned cogitation, apart from reflective acceptance of a view, they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this — that is impossible.
