Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come — both alike are Māra's realm, Māra's domain, Māra's bait, Māra's hunting ground.

Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable now or else he resolvesupon itwith wisdom.

    "mn106:9": "When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, here a bhikkhu is practising thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine; it will not be, and it will not be mine. What exists, what has come to be, that I am abandoning.’ Thus he obtains equanimity.[n.1017] MA glosses: \"If the round of kamma had not been accumulated by me, now there would not be for me the round of results; if the round of kamma is not accumulated by me now, in the future there will not be the round of results.\" \"What exists, what has come to be\" are the five aggregates. The first part of the formula again seems to be a condensed formulation of a view held by non-Buddhists. Several suttas identify it as an expression for the annihilationist view, adapted by the Buddha with new meanings assigned to it. For other occurrences of this formula, seeSN iii.55–56,,183,206;AN iv.6–72, v.63.MA says that he obtains the equanimity of insight, but from ¶6b it seems that the equanimity of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is also intended.Venerable sir, does such a bhikkhu attain Nibbāna?\"",

Since he does not do so, his consciousness does not become dependent on it and does not cling to it. A bhikkhu without clinging, Ānanda, attains Nibbāna.\"",
