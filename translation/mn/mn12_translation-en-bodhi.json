    "mn12:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesālī in the grove outside the city to the west. Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline.[n.77] The Sunakkhatta Sutta (MN05) had been expounded to him by the Buddha, apparently before he joined the Saṅgha; the account of his defection is given in the Pāṭika SuttaDN24.He became dissatisfied and left the Order because the Buddha would not perform any miracles for him or explain to him the beginning of things.He was making this statement before the Vesālī assembly: \"The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.[n.78] Superhuman states(uttari manussadhammā)are states, virtues, or attainments higher than the ordinary human virtues comprised in the ten wholesome courses of action(see MN9.5); they include the jhānas, the kinds of direct knowledge, and the paths and fruits. \"Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\"(alamariyañāṇadassanavisesa), a frequently occurring expression in the suttas, signifies all higher degrees of meditative knowledge characteristic of the noble individual. Here, according toMA,it means specifically the supramundane path, which Sunakkhatta is denying of the Buddha.The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhammamerelyhammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering.\"[n.79] The gist of his criticism is that the Buddha teaches a doctrine that he has merely worked out in thought rather than one he has realised through transcendental wisdom. Apparently he believes that being led to the complete destruction of suffering is, as a goal, inferior to the acquisition of miraculous powers.",
    "mn12:2–3": "Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sāriputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesālī for alms. Then he heard Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, making this statement before the Vesālī assembly. When he had wandered for alms in Vesālī and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying.",
    "mn12:4": "The Blessed One said:\"Sāriputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of anger. Thinking to discredit the Tathāgata, he actually praises him; for it is praise of the Tathāgata to say of him: ‘When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering.’",
    "mn12:5": "\"Sāriputta, this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’[n.180] All the sections to follow are intended as a rebuttal of Sunakkhatta's criticism of the Buddha. ¶¶6–8 cover the first three of the six direct knowledges(abhiññā), the last three appearing as the last of the ten powers of the Tathāgata. The latter, according toMA,are to be understood as powers of knowledge(ñaṇabala)that are attained by all Buddhas as the fruit of their accumulation of merit. The Vibhaṅga (§§809–31/440–1) of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka provides an elaborate analysis of them.",
    "mn12:6": "\"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain, as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.’",
    "mn12:7": "\"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds, the heavenly and the human, those that are far as well as near.’",
    "mn12:8": "\"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings, other persons. He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.’",

Why was that? Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering.",

    "mn12:60": "\"Sāriputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘As long as this good man is still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom. But when this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.’ But it should not be regarded so. I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years’ lifespan, perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of wisdom.[n.197] The Pali for the four terms is:sati, gati, dhiti, paññāveyyattiya.MAexplainssatias the ability to grasp in mind a hundred or a thousand phrases as they are being spoken; gati as the ability to bind them and retain them in the mind;dhitias the ability to recite back what has been grasped and retained; andpaññāveyyattiyaas the ability to discern the meaning and logic of those phrases.Just as a skilled archer, trained, practised, and tested, could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat, drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate, and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness. Still the Tathāgata's exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors of the Dhamma, and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end, but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years’ lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years. Sāriputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathāgata's wisdom.",
    "mn12:61": "Now on that occasion the venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him.[n.198] Ven. Nāgasamāla had been a personal attendant of the Buddha during the first twenty years of his ministry.Then he said to the Blessed One: \"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma, the hairs of my body stood up. Venerable sir, what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma?\"",
    "mn12:62": "That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Nāgasamāla was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words."
