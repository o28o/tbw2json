    "mn118:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migāra's Mother, together with many very well known elder disciples — the venerable Sāriputta, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa, the venerable Mahā Kaccāna, the venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita, the venerable Mahā Kappina, the venerable Mahā Cunda, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ānanda, and other very well known elder disciples.",
    "mn118:2": "Now on that occasion elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing new bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing ten bhikkhus, some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing twenty … thirty … forty bhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus, had achieved successive stages of high distinction.",
    "mn118:3": "On that occasion — the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the full-moon night of the Pavāraṇā ceremony[n.1115] The Pavāraṇā is the ceremony that concludes the rains residence, at which each bhikkhu invites all the others to admonish him for his transgressions.— the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Saṅgha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:",
    "mn118:4": "On that occasion — the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the Komudī full moon of the fourth month — the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Saṅgha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:",
    "mn118:5": "\"Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from prattle, this assembly is free from chatter. It consists purely of heartwood. Such is this Saṅgha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an incomparable field of merit for the world — such is this Saṅgha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly that a small gift given to it becomes great and a great gift greater — such is this Saṅgha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as is rare for the world to see — such is this Saṅgha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as would be worth journeying many leagues with a travel-bag to see — such is this Saṅgha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.",
    "mn118:6": "\"In this Saṅgha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge — such bhikkhus are there in this Saṅgha of bhikkhus.",
    "mn118:7": "\"In this Saṅgha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four foundations of mindfulness — such bhikkhus are there in this Saṅgha of bhikkhus. In this Saṅgha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four right kinds of striving … of the four bases for spiritual power … of the five faculties … of the five powers … of the seven enlightenment factors … of the Noble Eightfold Path — such bhikkhus are there in this Saṅgha of bhikkhus.",
    "mn118:8": "\"And how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?",
    "mn118:9": "\"Breathing in long, he understands:[n.1117] Explanatory notes for the first tetrad will be found atnn.140–142.MN 10.4differs from this passage only by the addition of the simile. Since Ācariya Buddhaghosa has commented on the four tetrads on mindfulness of breathing in theVisuddhimagga,in MA he merely refers the reader to the latter work for explanation. Notes 1118–21 are drawn from Vsm VIII, 226–37, also included by Ñm in hisMindfulness of Breathing.‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole bodyof breath’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole bodyof breath.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’",
    "mn118:10": "\"He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing rapture’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing rapture.’[n.1118] One experiences rapture in two ways: by attaining one of the lower two jhānas in which rapture is present, one experiences rapture in the mode of serenity; by emerging from that jhāna and contemplating that rapture as subject to destruction, one experiences rapture in the mode of insight.He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing pleasure’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing pleasure.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation. ’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the mental formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the mental formation.’[n.1119] The same method of explanation as inn.1118applies to the second and third clauses, except that the second comprises the three lower jhānas and the third all four jhānas. The mental formation is perception and feeling (seeMN 44.14), which is tranquillised by the development of successively higher levels of serenity and insight.",
    "mn118:11": "\"He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in gladdening the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out gladdening the mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in concentrating the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out concentrating the mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in liberating the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out liberating the mind.’[n.20] \"Experiencing the mind\" is to be understood by way of the four jhānas. \"Gladdening the mind\" is explained either as the attainment of the two jhānas containing rapture or as the penetration of those jhānas with insight as subject to destruction, etc. \"Concentrating the mind\" refers either to the concentration pertaining to the jhāna or to the momentary concentration that arises along with insight. \"Liberating the mind\" means liberating it from hindrances and grosser jhānic factors by successively higher levels of concentration, and from the cognitive distortions by way of insight knowledge.",
    "mn118:12": "\"He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence. ’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating fading away’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating fading away.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating cessation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating cessation.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment. ’[n.11] This tetrad deals entirely with insight, unlike the previous three, which deal with both serenity and insight. \"Contemplating fading away\" and \"contemplating cessation\" can be understood both as the insight into the impermanence of formations and as the supramundane path realising Nibbāna, called the fading away of lust (i.e., dispassion,virāga) and the cessation of suffering. \"Contemplating relinquishment\" is the giving up of defilements through insight and the entering into Nibbāna by attainment of the path.",

I say that this is a certain feeling among the feelings, namely, giving close attention to in-breathing and out-breathing.[n.1123]MAexplains that close attention(sādhuka manasikāra)is not itself actually feeling, but is spoken of as such only figuratively. In the second tetrad the actual feeling is the pleasure mentioned in the second clause and also the feeling comprised by the expression \"mental formation\" in the third and fourth clauses.That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.",

I do not say that there is the development of mindfulness of breathing for one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware. That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.[n.1124]MA: Although the meditating bhikkhu takes as his object the sign of in-and-out breathing, he is said to be \"contemplating mind as mind\" because he maintains his mind on the object by arousing mindfulness and full awareness, two factors of mind.",

Having seen with wisdom the abandoning of covetousness and grief, he closely looks on with equanimity.[n.1125]MA: Covetousness and grief signify the first two hindrances, sensual desire and ill will, and thus represent the contemplation of mind-objects, which begins with the five hindrances. The bhikkhu sees the abandoning of the hindrances effected by the contemplations of impermanence, fading away, cessation, and relinquishment, and thus comes to look upon the object with equanimity.That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.",
