    "mn63:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.",
    "mn63:2": "Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mālunkyāputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him:",
    "mn63:3": "\"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the following thought arose in my mind: ‘These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One … If he does not declare these to me, then I will abandon the training and return to the low life.’ If the Blessed One knows ‘the world is eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to me ‘the world is eternal’; if the Blessed One knows ‘the world is not eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to me ‘the world is not eternal.’ If the Blessed One does not know either ‘the world is eternal’ or ‘the world is not eternal, ’ then it is straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’",
    "mn63:4": "\"How then, Mālunkyāputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, Mālunkyāputta, lead the holy life under me and I will declare to you \"the world is eternal\" … or \"after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist\"’?\"",
    "mn63:5": "\"No, venerable sir.\"",
    "mn63:6": "\"Did you ever tell me: ‘I will lead the holy life under the Blessed One, and the Blessed One will declare to me \"the world is eternal\" … or \"after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist\"’?\"",
    "mn63:7": "\"No, venerable sir.\"",
    "mn63:8": "\"That being so, misguided man, who are you and what are you abandoning?",
    "mn63:9": "\"If anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me \"the world is eternal\" … or \"after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,\"’ \"All this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die. So too, Mālunkyāputta, if anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me: \"the world is eternal\" … or \"after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,\"’ that would still remain undeclared by the Tathāgata and meanwhile that person would die.",
    "mn63:10": "\"Mālunkyāputta, if there is the view ‘the world is eternal,’ the holy life cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘the world is not eternal,’ the holy life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view ‘the world is eternal’ or the view ‘the world is not eternal,’ there is birth, there is ageing, there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.",
    "mn63:11": "\"Therefore, Mālunkyāputta, remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared. And what have I left undeclared? ‘The world is eternal’ — I have left undeclared. ‘The world is not eternal’ — I have left undeclared. ‘The world is finite’ — I have left undeclared. ‘The world is infinite’ — I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is the same as the body’ — I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’ — I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathāgata exists’ — I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathāgata does not exist’ — I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ — I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’ — I have left undeclared.",
    "mn63:12": "That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Mālunkyāputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.[n.648] Those who have always wondered about the fate of the monk who almost left the Buddha to satisfy his metaphysical curiosity will be gladdened to know that in his old age Mālunkyāputta received a brief discourse on the six sense bases from the Buddha, went off into solitary meditation, and attained arahantship. SeeSN 35:95/ iv.72–76. His verses are atThag 399–404and794–817."
