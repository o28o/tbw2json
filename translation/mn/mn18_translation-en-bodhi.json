    "mn18:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.",
    "mn18:2": "When this was said, Daṇḍapāni the Sakyan shook his head, wagged his tongue, and raised his eyebrows until his forehead was puckered in three lines.[n.8] This response seems to be an expression of frustration and bewilderment.Then he departed, leaning on his stick.",
    "mn18:3–4": "Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to Nigrodha's Park, where he sat down on a seat made ready for him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place.",
    "mn18:5": "Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:",
    "mn18:6": "Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered: \"Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?\" Then they considered: \"The venerable Mahā Kaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.[n.230] Ven. Mahā Kaccāna was declared by the Buddha to be the most eminent disciple in expounding the detailed meaning of a brief saying.MN 133andMN 138were also spoken by him under similar circumstances.He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this.\"",
    "mn18:7": "Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down to one side and told him what had taken place, adding: \"Let the venerable Mahā Kaccāna expound it to us.\"",
    "mn18:8": "The venerable Mahā Kaccāna replied:\"Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, thought that heartwood should be sought for among the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it is with you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked about the meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when you were face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the holy one;[n.231]Cakkhubhūto ñāṇabhūto dhammabhūto brahmabhūto.MA:He is vision in the sense that he is the leader in vision; he is knowledge in the sense that he makes things known; he is the Dhamma in the sense that he consists of the Dhamma that he utters verbally after considering it in his heart; he is Brahmā, the holy one, in the sense of the best.he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata. That was the time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told you, so you should have remembered it.\"",
    "mn18:9": "\"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning, that is: ‘Bhikkhu, as to the source through which perceptions and notionsborn ofmental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome, and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust … this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons … here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder,’ I understand the detailed meaning of it to be as follows:",
    "mn18:10": "\"Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What one feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one thinks about. What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates. With what one has mentally proliferated as the source, perceptions and notionsborn ofmental proliferation beset a man with respect to past, future, and present forms cognizable through the eye.[n.232] This passage shows howpapañca,emerging from the process of cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and victimise their hapless creator. Ms contains a note by Ñm: \"The meeting of eye, form, and eye-consciousness is called contact. Contact, according to dependent origination, is the principal condition of feeling. Feeling and perception are inseparable (MN 43.9). What is perceived as ‘this’ is thought about in its differences and is thus diversified from ‘that’ and from ‘me.’ This diversification — involving craving for form, wrong view about permanence of form, etc., and the conceit ‘I am’ — leads to preoccupation with calculating the desirability of past and present forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future. \" Perhaps the key to the interpretation of this passage is Ven. Mahā Kaccāna's explanation of the Bhaddekaratta verses inMN 133. There too delight in the elements of cognition plays a prominent role in causing bondage, and the elaboration of the verses in terms of the three periods of time links up with the reference to the three times in this sutta.",
    "mn18:11": "\"When there is the eye, a form, and eye-consciousness, it is possible to point out the manifestation of contact.[n.233] The Pali idiomphassapaññattiṁ paññāpessati,in which the verb takes an object derived from itself, is difficult. Ñm originally rendered \"that one will describe a description of contact.\" \"To point out a manifestation\" is less literal, but it should do justice to the meaning without jeopardising intelligibility. MA says that this passage is intended to show the entire round of existence(vaṭṭa)by way of the twelve sense bases; verse 18 shows the cessation of the round(vaṭṭa)by the negation of the twelve sense bases.When there is the manifestation of contact, it is possible to point out the manifestation of feeling. When there is the manifestation of feeling, it is possible to point out the manifestation of perception. When there is the manifestation of perception, it is possible to point out the manifestation of thinking. When there is the manifestation of thinking, it is possible to point out the manifestation of besetment by perceptions and notionsborn ofmental proliferation.",
    "mn18:12": "\"When there is no eye, no form, and no eye-consciousness, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of contact. When there is no manifestation of contact, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of feeling. When there is no manifestation of feeling, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of perception. When there is no manifestation of perception, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of thinking. When there is no manifestation of thinking, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of besetment by perceptions and notionsborn ofmental proliferation.",
    "mn18:13": "\"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning, that is: ‘Bhikkhu, as to the source through which perceptions and notionsborn ofmental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome, and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust, of the underlying tendency to aversion, of the underlying tendency to views, of the underlying tendency to doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit, of the underlying tendency to desire for being, of the underlying tendency to ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malicious words, and false speech; here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder,’ I understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thus. Now, friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so you should remember it.\"",
    "mn18:14": "Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Mahā Kaccāna's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding: \"Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna and asked him about the meaning. The venerable Mahā Kaccāna expounded the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and phrases.\"",
    "mn18:15": "When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness came upon a honeyball,[n.234] A large sweet cake or a ball made from flour, ghee, molasses, honey, sugar, etc. See alsoAN 5:194/iii.237.wherever he would taste it he would find a sweet delectable flavour; so too, venerable sir, any able-minded bhikkhu, wherever he might scrutinize with wisdom the meaning of this discourse on the Dhamma, would find satisfaction and confidence of mind. Venerable sir, what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma?\"",
    "mn18:16": "That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ānanda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words."
