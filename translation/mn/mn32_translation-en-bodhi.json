    "mn32:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Park of the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood together with a number of very well-known elder disciples — the venerable Sāriputta, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ānanda, and other very well known elder disciples.",
    "mn32:2": "The venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance and said to the venerable Ānanda: \"Let the venerable Ānanda come, welcome to the venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One's attendant, who is always in the Blessed One's presence. Friend Ānanda, the Gosiṅga Sālatree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ānanda, could illuminate the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:3": "When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Revata thus: \"Friend Revata, the venerable Ānanda has spoken according to his own inspiration.[n.58]Yathā sakaṁ paṭibhānaṁ.This phrase might also be rendered \"according to his own intuition\" or \"according to his own ideal.\" Ñm renders \"as it occurs to him\"; Horner, \"according to his own capacity.\"Now we ask the venerable Revata: Friend Revata, the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:4": "When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: \"Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha: Friend Anuruddha, the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:5": "When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus: \"Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahā Kassapa: Friend Kassapa, the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:6": "When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna thus: \"Friend Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahā Moggallāna: Friend Moggallāna, the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:7": "When this was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus: \"Friend Sāriputta, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Sāriputta: Friend Sāriputta, the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?\"",
    "mn32:8": "Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed those venerable ones thus: \"Friends, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the Blessed One answers, so let us remember it.\" — \"Yes, friend,\" they replied. Then those venerable ones went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:",
    "mn32:9": "\"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Revata thus: ‘Friend Revata … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Revata replied: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation …as in verse 5… That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood.’\"",
    "mn32:10": "\"When that was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: ‘Friend Anuruddha … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Anuruddha replied: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, with the divine eye …as in verse 6… That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood.’\"",
    "mn32:11": "\"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus: ‘Friend Kassapa … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Mahā Kassapa replied: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is a forest-dweller himself …as in verse 7… That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood.’\"",
    "mn32:12": "\"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna thus: ‘Friend Moggallāna … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma …as in verse 8… That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sālatree Wood.’\"",
    "mn32:13": "When that was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna told the Blessed One: \"Then, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus: ‘Friend Sāriputta … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Sāriputta replied: ‘Here, friend Moggallāna, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind …as in verse 9… That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood.’\"",
    "mn32:14": "When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta asked the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, which of us has spoken well?\" \"You have all spoken well, Sāriputta, each in his own way. Hear also from me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood. Here, Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu has returned from his almsround, after his meal, he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him, resolves: ‘I shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints.’ That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sālatree Wood.\"[n.363] While the replies of the disciples hold up as the ideal a bhikkhu who has already achieved proficiency in a particular sphere of the renunciant life, the Buddha’s reply, by focusing on a bhikkhu still striving for the goal, underscores the ultimate purpose of the holy life itself.",
    "mn32:15": "That is what the Blessed One said. Those venerable ones were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words."
