    "mn86:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.",
    "mn86:2": "For the second time … For the third time the cowherds, shepherds, ploughmen, and travellers told this to the Blessed One,",
    "mn86:3": "… but still the Blessed One went on in silence.",
    "mn86:4": "Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that the bandit Angulimāla, though running as fast as he could, could not catch up with the Blessed One, who was walking at his normal pace. Then the bandit Angulimāla thought: \"It is wonderful, it is marvellous! Formerly I could catch up even with a swift elephant and seize it; I could catch up even with a swift horse and seize it; I could catch up even with a swift chariot and seize it; I could catch up even with a swift deer and seize it; but now, though I am running as fast as I can, I cannot catch up with this recluse who is walking at his normal pace!\" He stopped and called out to the Blessed One: \"Stop, recluse! Stop, recluse!\"",
    "mn86:5": "Then the bandit Angulimāla addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:",
    "mn86:6": "\"While you are walking, recluse, you tell me you havestopped;But now, when I have stopped, you say I have not stopped.I ask you now, O recluse, about the meaning:How is it that you have stopped and I have not?\"",
    "mn86:7": "\"Angulimāla, I have stopped forever,I abstain from violence towards living beings;But you have no restraint towards things that live:That is why I have stopped and you have not.\"",
    "mn86:8": "\"Oh, at long last this recluse, a venerated sage,Has come to this great forest for my sake.[n.21]MAexplains that Angulimāla had just realised that the monk before him was the Buddha himself and that he had come to the forest for the express purpose of transforming him.Having heard your stanza teaching me the Dhamma,I will indeed renounce evil forever.\"",
    "mn86:9": "So saying, the bandit took his sword and weaponsAnd flung them in a gaping chasm's pit;The bandit worshipped the Sublime One's feet,And then and there asked for the going forth.",
    "mn86:10": "The Enlightened One, the Sage of Great Compassion,The Teacher of the world withallits gods,Addressed him with these words, \"Come, bhikkhu.\"And that was how he came to be a bhikkhu.",
    "mn86:11": "Then the Blessed One set out to wander back to Sāvatthī with Angulimāla as his attendant. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, and there he lived at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.",
    "mn86:12": "Then in the middle of the day King Pasenadi of Kosala drove out of Sāvatthī with a cavalry of five hundred men and set out for the park. He drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side, and the Blessed One said to him: \"What is it, great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha attacking you, or the Licchavis of Vesālī, or other hostile kings?\"",
    "mn86:13": "\"Venerable sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is not attacking me, nor are the Licchavis of Vesālī, nor are other hostile kings. But there is a bandit in my realm named Angulimāla, who is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. Villages, towns, and districts have been laid waste by him. He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a garland. I shall put him down, venerable sir.\"",
    "mn86:14": "\"Great king, suppose you were to see that Angulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and gone forth from the home life into homelessness; that he was abstaining from killing living beings, from taking what is not given and from false speech; that he was eating only one meal a day, and was celibate, virtuous, of good character. If you were to see him thus, how would you treat him?\"",
    "mn86:15": "Now on that occasion the venerable Angulimāla was sitting not far from the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One extended his right arm and said to King Pasenadi of Kosala: \"Great king, this is Angulimāla.\"",
    "mn86:16": "Then King Pasenadi was frightened, alarmed, and terrified. Knowing this, the Blessed One told him: \"Do not be afraid, great king, do not be afraid. There is nothing for you to fear from him.\"",
    "mn86:17": "\"Let the noble lord Gagga Mantāṇiputta rest content. I shall provide robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites for the noble lord Gagga Mantāṇiputta.\"",
    "mn86:18": "Now at that time the venerable Angulimāla was a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a refuse-rag wearer, and restricted himself to three robes. He replied: \"Enough, great king, my three robes are complete.\"",
    "mn86:19": "Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimāla dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. As he was wandering for alms from house to house in Sāvatthī, he saw a certain woman in difficult labour, in painful labour. When he saw this, he thought: \"How beings are afflicted! Indeed, how beings are afflicted!\"[n.822]MṬexplains the expressionmūḷhagabbhato mean that the fetus had turned over only partly in the womb and was being expelled horizontally, so that its exit was blocked. MA says that although Angulimāla had killed almost a thousand people, he had never given rise to a thought of compassion. But now, through the power of his ordination, compassion arose in him as soon as he saw the woman in painful labour.",
    "mn86:20": "\"In that case, Angulimāla, go into Sāvatthī and say to that woman: ‘Sister, since I was born, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and may your infant be well!’\"",
    "mn86:21": "\"Venerable sir, wouldn’t I be telling a deliberate lie, for I have intentionally deprived many living beings of life?\"",
    "mn86:22": "\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the venerable Angulimāla replied, and having gone into Sāvatthī, he told that woman: \"Sister, since I was born with the noble birth, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and may your infant be well!\" Then the woman and the infant became well.",
    "mn86:23": "Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Angulimāla, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew: \"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" And the venerable Angulimāla became one of the arahants.",
    "mn86:24": "Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimāla dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. Now on that occasion someone threw a clod and hit the venerable Angulimāla's body, someone else threw a stick and hit his body, and someone else threw a potsherd and hit his body. Then, with blood running from his cut head, with his bowl broken, and with his outer robe torn, the venerable Angulimāla went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and told him: \"Bear it, brahmin! Bear it, brahmin! You are experiencing here and now the result of deeds because of which you might have been tortured in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years.\"[n.8]MAexplains that any volitional action(kamma)is capable of yielding three kinds of result: a result to be experienced here and now, i.e., in the same life in which the deed is committed; a result to be experienced in the next existence; and a result to be experienced in any life subsequent to the next, as long as one's sojourn in saṁsāra continues. Because he had attained arahantship, Angulimāla had escaped the latter two types of result but not the first, since even arahants are susceptible to experiencing the present-life results of actions they performed before attaining arahantship.",
    "mn86:25": "\"Who once did live in negligenceAnd then is negligent no more,He illuminates this worldLike the moon freed from a cloud.",
    "mn86:26": "Who checks the evil deeds he didBy doing wholesome deeds instead,He illuminates this worldLike the moon freed from a cloud.",
    "mn86:27": "The youthful bhikkhu who devotesHis efforts to the Buddha’s teaching,He illuminates this worldLike the moon freed from a cloud.",
    "mn86:28": "Let my enemies hear discourse on the Dhamma,Let them be devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,Let my enemies wait on those good peopleWho lead others to accept the Dhamma.",
    "mn86:29": "Let my enemies give ear from time to timeAnd hear the Dhamma of those who preach forbearance,Of those who speak as well in praise of kindness,And let them follow up with kind deeds.",
    "mn86:30": "For surely then they would not wish to harm me,Nor would they think of harming other beings,So those who would protect all, frail or strong,Let them attain the all-surpassing peace.",
    "mn86:31": "Conduit-makers guide the water,Fletchers straighten out the arrow-shaft,Carpenters straighten out the timber,But wise men seek to tame themselves.",
    "mn86:32": "There are some that tame with beatings,Some with goads and some with whips;But I was tamed by such a oneWho has no rod nor any weapon.",
    "mn86:33": "‘Harmless’ is the name I bear,Though I was dangerous in the past.[n.826] AlthoughMAsays that Ahiṁsaka, \"Harmless,\" was Angulimāla's given name, the commentary to the Theragāthā says his original name was Hiṁsaka, meaning \"dangerous.\"The name I bear today is true:I hurt no living being at all.",
    "mn86:34": "And though I once lived as a banditKnown to all as ‘Finger-garland,’One whom the great flood swept along,I went for refuge to the Buddha.",
    "mn86:35": "And though I once was bloody-handedWith the name of ‘Finger-garland,’See the refuge I have found:The bond of being has been cut.",
    "mn86:36": "While I did many deeds that leadTo rebirth in the evil realms,Yet their result has reached me now,And so I eat free from debt.[n.827] Whereas virtuous bhikkhus short of arahants are said to eat the country's almsfood as an inheritance from the Buddha, the arahant eats \"free from debt\" because he has made himself fully worthy of receiving alms. See Vsm I, 125–27.",
    "mn86:37": "They are fools and have no senseWho give themselves to negligence,But those of wisdom guard diligenceAnd treat it as their greatest good.",
    "mn86:38": "Do not give way to negligenceNor seek delight in sensual pleasures,But meditate with diligenceSo as to reach the perfect bliss.",
    "mn86:39": "So welcome to that choice of mineAnd let it stand, it was not ill made;Of all the teachings resorted to,I have come to the very best.",
    "mn86:40": "So welcome to that choice of mineAnd let it stand, it was not ill made;I have attained the triple knowledgeAnd done all that the Buddha teaches.\""
