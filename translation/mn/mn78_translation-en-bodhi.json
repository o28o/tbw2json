    "mn78:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta was staying in Mallikā's Park, the single-halled Tinduka plantation for philosophical debates,[n.77]MA: The park had been built by Queen Mallikā, the wife of King Pasenadi of Kosala, and beautified with flower trees and fruit trees. At first only one hall was built, which accounts for its name, but afterwards many halls were built. Various companies of brahmins and wanderers would assemble here to expound and discuss their doctrines.together with a large following of wanderers, with as many as three hundred wanderers.",
    "mn78:2": "Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggāhamāna was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk,Tiracchānakathā. Many translators render this expression as \"animal talk.\" However, tiracchāna means literally \"going horizontally,\" and though this term is used as a designation for animals, MA explains that in the present context it means talk that goes \"horizontally\" or \"perpendicularly\" to the path leading to heaven and liberation.such as talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells, the dead, trifles, the origin of the world, the origin of the sea, whether things are so or are not so.",
    "mn78:3": "The wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta saw the carpenter Pañcakanga coming in the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus: \"Sirs, be quiet; sirs make no noise. Here comes the carpenter Pañcakanga, a disciple of the recluse Gotama, one of the recluse Gotama's white-clothed lay disciples staying at Sāvatthī. These venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.\" Then the wanderers became silent.",
    "mn78:4": "The carpenter Pañcakanga went to the wanderer Uggāhamāna and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The wanderer Uggāhamāna then said to him:",
    "mn78:5": "Then the carpenter Pañcakanga neither approved nor disapproved of the wanderer Uggāhamāna's words. Without doing either he rose from his seat and went away, thinking: \"I shall learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed One.\"",
    "mn78:6": "\"If that were so, carpenter, then a young tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome, an ascetic invincible attained to the supreme attainment, according to the wanderer Uggāhamāna's statement. For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘body,’ so how should he do an evil bodily action beyond mere wriggling? A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘speech,’ so how should he utter evil speech beyond mere whining? A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘intention,’ so how should he have evil intentions beyond mere sulking? A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘livelihood,’ so how should he make his living by evil livelihood beyond being suckled at his mother's breast? If that were so, carpenter, then a young tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome … according to the wanderer Uggāhamāna's statement.",
    "mn78:7": "\"When a man possesses four qualities, carpenter, I describe him, not as accomplished in what is wholesome or perfected in what is wholesome or an ascetic invincible attained to the supreme attainment, but as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying prone. What are the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions, he utters no evil speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not make his living by any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these four qualities, I describe him, not as accomplished … but as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying prone.",
    "mn78:8": "\"When a man possesses ten qualities, carpenter, I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome, an ascetic invincible attained to the supreme attainment.But first of allI say, it must be understood thus:[n.772]MA: First the Buddha shows the plane of the arahant, the one beyond training (i.e., by mentioning the ten qualities), then he sets up an outline applicable to thesekha,the disciple in higher training. The word rendered as \"habits\" issīla,which in some contexts can assume a wider raṅge of meaning than \"virtue.\"‘These are unwholesome habits,’ and thus: ‘Unwholesome habits originate from this,’ and thus: ‘Unwholesome habits cease without remainder here,’ and thus: ‘One practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits.’",

Their cessation is stated: here a bhikkhu abandons bodily misconduct and develops good bodily conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops good verbal conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops good mental conduct; he abandons wrong livelihood and gains a living by right livelihood.[n.773]MAexplains that this refers to the fruit of stream-entry, for it is at that point that the virtue of restraint by the Pāṭimokkha is fulfilled (and, for a lay Buddhist, the observance of the Five Precepts). MA will also explain the subsequent passages by reference to the other supramundane paths and fruits. Although the text of the sutta does not expressly mention these attainments, the commentarial interpretation seems to be justified by the expression \"cease without remainder\"(aparisesā nirujjhanti), for it is only with the attainment of the respective paths and fruits that a total cessation of the particular defilement occurs. The commentary's view is further supported by the culmination of the entire discourse in the figure of the arahant.It is here that unwholesome habits cease without remainder.",
    "mn78:15": "\"And how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits?

Their cessation is stated: here a bhikkhu is virtuous, but he does not identify with his virtue, and he understands as it actually is that deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom where these wholesome habits cease without remainder.[n.775] This passage shows the arahant, who maintains virtuous conduct but no longer identifies with his virtue by conceiving it as \"I\" and \"mine.\" Since his virtuous habits no longer generate kamma, they are not describable as \"wholesome.\"",

It is here that unwholesome intentions cease without remainder .[n.777]MA: This refers to the first jhāna pertaining to the fruit of non-returning.
