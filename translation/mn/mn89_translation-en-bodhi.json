    "mn89:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country where there was a town of the Sakyans named Medaḷumpa.",
    "mn89:2": "Then he told Dīgha Kārāyaṇa what he had thought and asked, \"Where is he living now, the Blessed One, Accomplished and fully enlightened?\" There is, sire, a town of the Sakyans named Medaḷumpa. The Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living there.\"",
    "mn89:3": "Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open. Then King Pasenadi went to them and asked: \"Venerable sirs, where is he living now, the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened? We want to see the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened.\"",
    "mn89:4": "\"But, great king, what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to this body and for showing such friendship?\"",
    "mn89:5": "\"Again, venerable sir, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders; mother quarrels with son, son with mother, father with son, son with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.[n.838] AtMN 13.11these quarrels are said to arise because of sensual pleasures.But here I see bhikkhus living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes. I do not see any other assembly elsewhere with such concord. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way.’",
    "mn89:6": "\"Again, venerable sir, I have walked and wandered from park to park and from garden to garden. There I have seen some recluses and brahmins who are lean, wretched, unsightly, jaundiced, with veins standing out on their limbs, such that people would not want to look at them again. I have thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones are leading the holy life in discontent, or they have done some evil deed and are concealing it, so lean and wretched are they … such that people would not want to look at them again.’ I went up to them and asked: ‘Why are you venerable ones so lean and wretched … such that people would not want to look at you again?’ Their reply was: ‘It is our family sickness, great king.’ But here I see bhikkhus smiling and cheerful, sincerely joyful, plainly delighting, their faculties fresh, living at ease, unruffled, subsisting on what others give, abiding with mindas aloofas a wild deer's. I have thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed One's Dispensation, since they abide thus smiling and cheerful … with mindas aloofas a wild deer's.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way.’",
    "mn89:7": "\"Again, venerable sir, being a head-anointed noble king, I am able to have executed those who should be executed, to fine those who should be fined, to exile those who should be exiled. Yet when I am sitting in council, they break in and interrupt me. Though I say: ‘Gentlemen, do not break in and interrupt me when I am sitting in council; wait till the end of my speech,’ still they break in and interrupt me. But here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is teaching the Dhamma[n.839] As atMN .6.to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing his throat. Once the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers and there a disciple of his cleared his throat. Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate: ‘Be quiet, venerable sir, make no noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the Dhamma.’ I thought: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous how an assembly can be so well disciplined without force or weapon!’ Indeed, I do not see any other assembly elsewhere so well disciplined. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way.’",
    "mn89:8": "\"Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever, knowledgeable about the doctrines of others, as sharp as hairsplitting marksmen;[n.40] As atMN 27.4–7.they wander about, as it were, demolishing the views of others with their sharp wits. When they hear: ‘The recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or town,’ they formulate a question thus: ‘We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this question. If he is asked like this, he will answer like this, and so we will refute his doctrine in this way; and if he is asked like that, he will answer like that, and so we will refute his doctrine in that way.’ They hear: ‘The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or town.’ They go to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One instructs, urges, rouses, and gladdens them with a talk on the Dhamma. After they have been instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, they do not so much as ask him the question, so how should they refute his doctrine? In actual fact, they become his disciples. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way.’",
    "mn89:9": "\"Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned brahmins …",
    "mn89:10": "\"Again, venerable sir, Isidatta and Purāṇa,[n.841] At the time of their deaths both were declared by the Buddha to be once-returners. SeeAN 6:44/iii.348.my two inspectors, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame. Yet despite this, they do not do such honour to me as they do to the Blessed One. Once when I had gone out leading an army and was testing these inspectors, Isidatta and Purāṇa, I happened to put up in very cramped quarters. Then these two inspectors, Isidatta and Purāṇa, after spending much of the night in talk on the Dhamma, lay down with their heads in the direction where they had heard that the Blessed One was staying and with their feet towards me. I thought: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These two inspectors, Isidatta and Purāṇa, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame. Yet in spite of this, they are less respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed One. Surely these good people perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed One's Dispensation.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way.’",
    "mn89:11": "\"Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is a noble and I am a noble; the Blessed One is a Kosalan and I am a Kosalan; the Blessed One is eighty years old and I am eighty years old.[n.842] This statement indicates that this sutta can be assigned to the last year of the Buddha’s life.Since that is so, I think it proper to do such supreme honour to the Blessed One and to show such friendship.",
    "mn89:12": "Then soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, before rising from his seat and departing, this King Pasenadi uttered monuments to the Dhamma.[n.844]MA: \"Monuments to the Dhamma\" means words expressing reverence to the Dhamma. Whenever reverence is shown towards any of the Three Jewels, it is also shown to the others.Learn the monuments to the Dhamma, bhikkhus; master the monuments to the Dhamma; remember the monuments to the Dhamma. The monuments to the Dhamma are beneficial, bhikkhus, and they belong to the fundamentals of the holy life.\"",
    "mn89:13": "That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words."
