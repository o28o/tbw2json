On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.Then a number of bhikkhus fromthe Blessed One'snative land[n.285] The parenthetical specification is supplied fromMA. The Buddha’s native land is Kapilavatthu, at the foot of the Himalayas.who had spent the Rains there, went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked them:",

Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta: \"It is a gain for the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, it is a great gain for him that his wise companions in the holy life praise him point by point in the Teacher's presence. Perhaps sometime or other we might meet the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta and have some conversation with him.\"",

Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī and went to Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park, to see the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened him with talk on the Dhamma. Then the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened by the Blessed One's talk on the Dhamma, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he went to the Blind Men's Grove for the day's abiding.",

The sevenfold scheme forms, however, the scaffolding for the entireVisuddhimagga,which defines the different stages by means of the fully developed commentarial traditions on concentration and insight meditation.In brief, \"purification of virtue\"(sīlavisuddhi)is the unbroken adherence to the moral precepts one has undertaken, explained by Vsm with reference to the moral training of a bhikkhu as the \"fourfold purification of virtue.\" \"Purification of mind\"(cittavisuddhi)is the overcoming of the five hindrances through the attainment of access concentration and the jhānas. \"Purification of view\"(diṭṭhivisuddhi)is the understanding that defines the nature of the five aggregates constituting a living being. \"Purification by overcoming doubt\"(kaṅkhāvitaraṇavisuddhi )is the understanding of conditionality. \"Purification by knowledge and vision of what is themaggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhipath and what is not the path\" ( ) is the correct discrimination between the false path of the ecstatic, exhilarating experiences and the true path of insight into impermanence, suffering, and not self. \"Purification by knowledge and vision of the way\"(paṭipadāñāṇadassanavisuddhi)comprises the ascending series of insight knowledges up to the supramundane paths. And \"purification by knowledge and vision\"(ñāṇadassanavisuddhi)is the supramundane paths.",
