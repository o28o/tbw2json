    "ud4.1:1": "Thus I heard:At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain. Then at that time venerable Meghiya was the Gracious One's attendent.",
    "ud4.1:2": "Then venerable Meghiya having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Jantugāma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantugāma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, he went to the bank of the river KimikālāBlack-Worm River, and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, he saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove.",
    "ud4.1:3": "Then venerable Meghiya went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One:",
    "ud4.1:4": "\"Here, reverend Sir, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up my bowl and robe, I entered Jantugāma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantugāma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, I went to the bank of the river Kimikālā, and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, I saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove.",
    "ud4.1:5": "When that was said, the Gracious One said this to venerable Meghiya: \"You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.\"",
    "ud4.1:6": "For a second time the Gracious One said this to venerable Meghiya: \"You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.\"",
    "ud4.1:7": "For a third time venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One: \"There is nothing further for the Gracious One to do, reverend Sir, there is nothing to add to what has been done. But for me, reverend Sir, there issomethingfurther to do, there issomethingto add to what has been done. If the Gracious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove for striving.\"",
    "ud4.1:8": "Then venerable Meghiya, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went to that mango grove, and after going and entering that mango grove, he sat down to dwell for the day at the root of a certain tree.",
    "ud4.1:9": "Then it occured to venerable Meghiya: \"Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, that I who, out of faith, have gone forth from the home to homelessness, should then be ensnared by these three bad, unwholesome thoughts, that is to say: by the thought of sensual pleasure, by the thought of ill-will, by the thought of harming.",
    "ud4.1:10": "Then venerable Meghiya, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One:",
    "ud4.1:11": "\"For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, there are five things that lead to maturity. What five?",
    "ud4.1:12": "\"Here, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the first thing that leads to maturity.",
    "ud4.1:13": "\"Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is virtuous, he lives restrained with the Pāṭimokkha restraint, and is endowed withsuitableconduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, he trains in the training rules he has undertaken. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the second thing that leads to maturity.",
    "ud4.1:14": "\"Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk has talk about what is very austere, that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and Emancipation, such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion, talk on disassociation, talk on arousing energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration, talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom. Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the third thing that leads to maturity.",
    "ud4.1:15": "\"Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk dwells with energy aroused for the giving up of unwholesome things, for the taking up of wholesome things, steadfast, of firm endeavour, one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the fourth thing that leads to maturity.",
    "ud4.1:16": "\"Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is wise, he is endowed with wisdom that leads toseeingrise and disappearance, with noble penetration, that leads to the complete destruction of suffering. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the fifth thing that leads to maturity.",
    "ud4.1:17": "\"It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will be virtuous, that he will live restrained with the Pāṭimokkha restraint, and will be endowed withsuitableconduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest fault, and will train in the training rules he has undertaken.",
    "ud4.1:18": "\"It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will have talk that is very austere, that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and Emancipation, such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion, talk on disassociation, talk on stirring up energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration, talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom.

    "ud4.1:21": "\"Then, Meghiya, with a monk who is established in these five things, four further things ought be be developed:",
    "ud4.1:22": "Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:",
    "ud4.1:23": "\"There arelow thoughts, fine thoughts,Together with elation in the mind,Not having understood these thoughts of the mind,The unsteady mind runs here and there.",
    "ud4.1:24": "\"Having understood these thoughts of the mind,He who is ardent, mindful, restrains them.Alsoelations that have not arisen in the mind —An Awakened one has given these up completely.\""
