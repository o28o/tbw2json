    "dhp383-423:383": "Exert yourself, O holy man! Cut off the stream (of craving), and discard sense desires. Knowing the destruction of all the conditioned things, become, O holy man, the knower of the Uncreated (Nibbāna)!",
    "dhp383-423:384": "When a holy man has reached the summit of two paths (meditative concentration and insight), he knows the truth and all his fetters fall away.",
    "dhp383-423:385": "He for whom there is neither this shore nor the other shore, nor yet both, he who is free of cares and is unfettered — him do I call a holy man.",

    "dhp383-423:389": "One should not strike a holy man, nor should a holy man, when struck, give way to anger. Shame on him who strikes a holy man, and more shame on him who gives way to anger.",
    "dhp383-423:390": "Nothing is better for a holy man than when he holds his mind back from what is endearing. To the extent the intent to harm wears away, to that extent does suffering subside.",
    "dhp383-423:391": "He who does no evil in deed, word and thought, who is restrained in these three ways — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:392": "Just as a brahman priest reveres his sacrificial fire, even so should one devoutly revere the person from whom one has learned the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.",
    "dhp383-423:393": "Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist — he is pure, he is a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:394": "What is the use of your matted hair, O witless man? What of your garment of antelope's hide? Within you is the tangle (of passion); only outwardly do you cleanse yourself.",
    "dhp383-423:395": "The person who wears a robe made of rags, who is lean, with veins showing all over the body, and who meditates alone in the forest — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:396": "I do not call him a holy man because of his lineage or high-born mother. If he is full of impeding attachments, he is just a supercilious man. But who is free from impediments and clinging — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:397": "He who, having cut off all fetters, trembles no more, who has overcome all attachments and is emancipated — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:398": "He who has cut off the thong (of hatred), the band (of craving), and the rope (of false views), together with the appurtenances (latent evil tendencies), he who has removed the crossbar (of ignorance) and is enlightened — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:399": "He who without resentment endures abuse, beating and punishment; whose power, real might, is patience — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:400": "He who is free from anger, is devout, virtuous, without craving, self-subdued and bears his final body — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:401": "Like water on a lotus leaf, or a mustard seed on the point of a needle, he who does not cling to sensual pleasures — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:402": "He who in this very life realizes for himself the end of suffering, who has laid aside the burden and become emancipated — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:403": "He who has profound knowledge, who is wise, skilled in discerning the right or wrong path, and has reached the highest goal — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:404": "He who holds aloof from householders and ascetics alike, and wanders about with no fixed abode and but few wants — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:405": "He who has renounced violence towards all living beings, weak or strong, who neither kills nor causes others to kill — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:406": "He who is friendly amidst the hostile, peaceful amidst the violent, and unattached amidst the attached — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:407": "He whose lust and hatred, pride and hypocrisy have fallen off like a mustard seed from the point of a needle — him do I call a holy man.",

    "dhp383-423:413": "He, who, like the moon, is spotless and pure, serene and clear, who has destroyed the delight in existence — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:414": "He who, having traversed this miry, perilous and delusive round of existence, has crossed over and reached the other shore; who is meditative, calm, free from doubt, and, clinging to nothing, has attained to Nibbāna — him do I call a holy man.",
    "dhp383-423:415": "He who, having abandoned sensual pleasures, has renounced the household life and become a homeless one; has destroyed both sensual desire and continued existence — him do I call a holy man.",
