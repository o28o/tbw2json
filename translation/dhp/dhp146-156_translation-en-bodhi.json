    "dhp146-156:146": "When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?",
    "dhp146-156:147": "Behold this body — a painted image, a mass of heaped up sores, infirm, full of hankering — of which nothing is lasting or stable!",
    "dhp146-156:148": "Fully worn out is this body, a nest of disease, and fragile. This foul mass breaks up, for death is the end of life.",
    "dhp146-156:149": "These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?",

    "dhp146-156:156": "Those who in youth have not lead the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, lie sighing over the past, like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow."
