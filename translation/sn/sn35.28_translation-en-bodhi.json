    "sn35.28:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gaya, at Gaya's Head, together with a thousand bhikkhus. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:[n.3] This sutta, often called \"The Fire Sermon,\" is the third discourse of the Buddha as recorded in the narrative of his ministry atKhandaka Vin I 34–35. According to this source, the thousand bhikkhus were former jaṭilamatted-hairascetics under the leadership of the three Kassapa brothers. The Buddha had converted them by a series of miracles, after which he preached the present sermon. The sermon gains special meaning from the fact that before their conversion these ascetics had been devoted to the fire sacrifice. The full account is atKhandaka Vin I 34–35; see Ñāṇamoli, Life of the Buddha, pp. 54–60, 64–69.Spk: Having led the thousand bhikkhus to Gaya's Head, the Blessed One reflected, \"What kind of Dhamma talk would be suitable for them?\" He then realized, \"In the past they worshipped the fire morning and evening. I will teach them that the twelve sense bases are burning and blazing. In this way they will be able to attain arahantship.\" In this sutta the characteristic of suffering is discussed.",
    "sn35.28:2": "This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by nonclinging."
