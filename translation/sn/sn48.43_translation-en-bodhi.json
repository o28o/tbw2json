    "sn48.43:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Saketa in the Añjana Grove, in the Deer Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:",
    "sn48.43:2": "\"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it.\" …",
    "sn48.43:3": "\"There is a method of exposition, bhikkhus, by means of which the five faculties become the five powers and the five powers become the five faculties.",
    "sn48.43:4": "And what is that method of exposition? That which is the faculty of faith is the power of faith; that which is the power of faith is the faculty of faith.[n.230] The statement as such seems to maintain that there is no essential difference between the faculties and the powers, that they are the same five factors viewed from two different angles. Though it is tempting to see the powers(bala)as a more highly developed stage than the faculties, nothing in the canon or the commentaries supports this idea.Spksays that one factor is the faculty of faith \"in the sense of exercising control in the characteristic of resolution\"(adhimokkhalakkhaṇe indaṭṭhena saddhindriyaṁ), and the power of faith \"in the sense of not being shaken by lack of faith\"(assaddhiye akampanena saddhābalaṁ). Similarly, the other four are faculties exercising control respectively in regard to application, establishment, nondistraction, and seeing(paggaha, upaṭṭhāna, avikkhepa, dassana); they are powers in that they are unshaken by laziness, forgetfulness, distraction, and ignorance.That which is the faculty of energy is the power of energy; that which is the power of energy is the faculty of energy. That which is the faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness; that which is the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. That which is the faculty of concentration is the power of concentration; that which is the power of concentration is the faculty of concentration. That which is the faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom; that which is the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom.",
    "sn48.43:5": "\"And what is the method of exposition by means of which that river could be considered to have one stream? Taking into account the water to the east of the island and the water to its west—this is the method of exposition by means of which that river could be considered to have one stream."
