    "sn51.8:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four bases for spiritual power. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving. These are the four bases for spiritual power. It is because he has developed and cultivated these four bases for spiritual power that the Tathāgata is called the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.\"sn.v.258"
