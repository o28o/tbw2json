    "sn17.36:1": "While dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion Prince Ajatasattu was going to attend upon Devadatta morning and evening with five hundred carts, and an offering of food was conveyed to him in five hundred pots. Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported this matter to the Blessed One.",
    "sn17.36:2": "\"Just as a wild dog becomes even wilder when they sprinkle bile over its nose,[n.335]Pittaṁ bhindeyyuṁ.PED, s.v.pittaṁ,says the passage is unclear and refers to an alternative interpretation proposed by Morris, JPTS 1893, 4. My rendering accords withSpk's comment: \"They throw(pakhippeyyuṁ)bear bile or fish bile over its nostrils.\" Spk-pṭ glossespakhippeyyuṁhere withosiñceyyuṁ,\"they sprinkle.\" Horner renders \"as if they were to throw a bladder at a fierce dog's nose\" (BD 5:63).so too, bhikkhus, so long as Prince Ajatasattu goes to attend upon Devadatta … only decline can be expected of Devadatta in regard to wholesome states, not growth. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
