    "sn21.11:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Mahakappina approached the Blessed One.[n.400] He was the foremost bhikkhu disciple among those who exhort bhikkhus (bhikkhu-ovādaka;AN I 25,3). His verses are atTh 547–56, and he is commended by the Buddha atSN54.7.Spk: He had been a king who ruled over the city of Kukkuṭavati. As soon as he heard about the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha from a group of travelling merchants he left his kingdom for Sāvatthī together with his thousand ministers, intending to go forth. His queen Anoja followed him, accompanied by the ministers’ wives, all with the same intention. The Buddha came out to meet both parties. He first ordained the men as bhikkhus with the \"Come, bhikkhu\" ordination, and then he had the women ordained as bhikkhunis by the elder nun Uppalavaṇṇā.The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, do you see that bhikkhu coming, fair-skinned, thin, with a prominent nose?\"",
    "sn21.11:2": "This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:",
    "sn21.11:3": "\"The khattiya is the best among peopleFor those whose standard is the clan,But one accomplished in knowledge and conductIs best among devas and humans.",
    "sn21.11:4": "\"The sun shines by day,The moon glows at night,The khattiya shines clad in armour,The meditative brahmin shines.But all the time, day and night,The Buddha shines with glory.\"sn.ii.285"
