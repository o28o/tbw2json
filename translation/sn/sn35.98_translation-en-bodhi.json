    "sn35.98:2": "\"And how, bhikkhus, is there restraint? There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he should understand this thus:sn.iv.80‘I am not declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called nondecline by the Blessed One.’"
