    "sn3.4:1": "At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: \"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Who now treat themselves as dear, and who treat themselves as a foe?’ Then, venerable sir, it occurred to me: ‘Those who engage in misconduct of body, speech, and mind treat themselves as a foe. Even though they may say, \"We regard ourselves as dear,\" still they treat themselves as a foe. For what reason?sn.i.72Because of their own accord they act towards themselves in the same way that a foe might act towards a foe; therefore they treat themselves as a foe. But those who engage in good conduct of body, speech, and mind treat themselves as dear. Even though they may say, \"We regard ourselves as a foe,\" still they treat themselves as dear. For what reason? Because of their own accord they act towards themselves in the same way that a dear person might act towards one who is dear; therefore they treat themselves as dear.’\"",
    "sn3.4:2": "\"So it is, great king! So it is, great king!\"",
    "sn3.4:3": "v.85\"If one regards oneself as dearOne should not yoke oneself to evil,For happiness is not easily gainedBy one who does a wrongful deed.",
    "sn3.4:4": "v.386\"When one is seized by the End-makerAs one discards the human state,What can one call truly one's own?What does one take when one goes?What follows one alongLike a shadow that never departs?[n.208] \"The End-maker\"(antaka), in pāda a, is a personification of death; elsewhere (e.g., atSN:1–6) the word refers expressly to Māra.",
    "sn3.4:5": "v.387\"Both the merits and the evilThat a mortal does right here:This is what is truly one's own,This one takes when one goes;This is what follows one alongLike a shadow that never departs.",
    "sn3.4:6": "v.388\"Therefore one should do what is goodAs a collection for the future life.Merits are the support for living beingsWhen they arisein the other world.\""
