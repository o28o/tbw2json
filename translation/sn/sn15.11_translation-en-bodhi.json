    "sn15.11:1": "On one occasion, while dwelling at Sāvatthī, the Blessed One said this: \"Bhikkhus, this saṁsara is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. Whenever you see anyone in misfortune, in misery, you can conclude: ‘We too have experienced the same thing in this long course.’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, this saṁsara is without discoverable beginning … . It is enough to be liberated from them.\""
