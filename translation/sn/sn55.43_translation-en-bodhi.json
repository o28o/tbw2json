    "sn55.43:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit. … What four?",
    "sn55.43:2": "\"Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha … in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha. …",
    "sn55.43:3": "\"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is wise, he possesses wisdom directed to arising and passing away,sn.v.402which is noble and penetrative, leading to the complete destruction of suffering. This is the fourth stream of merit. …",
    "sn55.43:4": "\"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to take the measure of his merit thus: ‘Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness’; rather, it is reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.\"",
    "sn55.43:5": "\"One who desires merit, established in the wholesome,Develops the path to attain the Deathless;He who has reached the Dhamma's core,Delighting in destruction,Does not tremble thinking,‘The King of Death will come.’\"[n.361]Spkglosses \"the Dhamma's core\"(dhammasāra)as the noble fruit, and \"destruction\"(khaya)as the destruction of defilements. I suggest reading the last line:Na vedhati maccurāj’ āgamissatī ti."
