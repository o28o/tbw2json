    "sn20.9:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion a certain newly ordained bhikkhu was approaching families excessively. The other bhikkhus told him: \"The venerable one should not approach families excessively,\" but when he was being admonished by them he said: \"These elder bhikkhus think they can approach families, so why can’t I?\"",
    "sn20.9:2": "Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side,sn.ii.69and reported this matter to the Blessed One.",
    "sn20.9:3": "The Blessed One said:\"Bhikkhus, once in the past there was a great lake in a forest, with bull elephants dwelling in its vicinity.[n.71] The elephant simile is also at Vin II 120, used in relation to Devadatta.Those elephants would plunge into the lake, pull up lotus stalks with their trunks, and, having washed them thoroughly, would chew them and swallow them free from mud. This increased their beauty and strength, and on that account they did not meet death or deadly suffering.",
    "sn20.9:4": "\"So too, bhikkhus, here the elder bhikkhus dress in the morning and, taking bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms. There they speak on the Dhamma, and the laypeople show their confidence to them.[n.372]Pasannākāraṁ karonti.Spk: They give the four requisites. See n.275.They use their gains without being tied to them, uninfatuated with them, not blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger in them and understanding the escape. This increases their beauty and strength, and on that account they do not meet death or deadly suffering."
