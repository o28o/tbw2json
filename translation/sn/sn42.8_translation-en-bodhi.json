On Nigaṇṭha Nataputta, seeSN4.8.approached the Blessed One … . The Blessed One then said to him as he was sitting to one side:",
    "sn42.8:2": "What do you think, headman? In the case of a person who destroys life, if one compares one occasion with another, whether by day or by night, which is more frequent: the occasions when he is destroying life or those when he is not doing so?\"",
    "sn42.8:3–5": "\"What do you think, headman? In the case of a person who takes what is not given … who engages in sexual misconduct …sn.iv.319who speaks falsehood, if one compares one occasion with another, whether by day or by night, which is more frequent: the occasions when he is speaking falsehood or those when he is not speaking falsehood?\"",
    "sn42.8:6": "\"Here, headman, some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this: ‘Anyone at all who destroys life … who takes what is not given … who engages in sexual misconduct … who speaks falsehood is bound for a state of misery, is bound for hell.’ Then a disciple has full confidence in that teacher. It occurs to him: ‘My teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this: \"Anyone at all who destroys life is bound for a state of misery, bound for hell.\" Now I have destroyed life, so I too am bound for a state of misery, bound for hell.’ Thus he acquires such a view. If he does not abandon that assertion and that state of mind, and if he does not relinquish that view, then according to his deserts he will be, as it were, dropped off in hell.[n.344]Yathābhataṃ(Ee:yathā hataṁ)nikkhitto evaṁ niraye.The idiom is obscure and the rendering here conjectural. The phrase also occurs atMN I 71,31, rendered at MLDB p. 17: \"then as (surely as if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.\" This rendering, which follows Ps II 32(yathā nirayapālehi ābharitvā niraye ̣hapito), is problematic, foryathābhataṁis an indeclinable with an adverbal function, not a substantive set in apposition to the subject. The function of evaṁ, too, is obscure. See the inconclusive discussion in PED, s.v.yathā.",
    "sn42.8:7": "\"But here, headman, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. In many ways he criticizes and censures the destruction of life, and he says: ‘Abstain from the destruction of life.’ He criticizes and censures the taking of what is not given, and he says: ‘Abstain from taking what is not given.’ He criticizes and censures sexual misconduct, and he says: ‘Abstain from sexual misconduct.’ He criticizes and censures false speech, and he says: ‘Abstain from false speech.’",

That wasn’t proper; that wasn’t good. But though I feel regret over this, that evil deed of mine cannot be undone.’ Having reflected thus,sn.iv.321he abandons the taking of what is not given and he abstains from taking what is not given in the future.

Just as a strong conch blower can easily send his signal to the four quarters, so too, when the liberation of mind by lovingkindness is developed and cultivated in this way, any limited kamma that was done does not remain there, does not persist there.[n.346] Cp.AN V 299–301.Spk: When (simple) \"lovingkindness\" is said, this can be interpreted either as access concentration or absorption, but when it is qualified as \"liberation of mind\"(cetovimutti)it definitely means absorption. It is sense-sphere kamma that is called limited kamma(pamāṇakatạ kammạ);form-sphere kamma is called limitless (or measureless,appamāṇakataṁ) kamma. This is called limitless because it is done by transcending the limit, for it is developed by way of specified, unspecified, and directional pervasion (see Vism 309–11; Ppn 9:49–58).Does not remain there, does not persist there(na taṃ tatrāvasissati, na taṃ tatrāvattị̣hati). Spk: That sense-sphere kamma does not linger on, does not stay on, in that form-sphere or formless-sphere kamma. What is meant? That sense-sphere kamma is unable to overpower the form-sphere or formless-sphere kamma or to persist and gain the opportunity (to yield its own results); rather, as a great flood might inundate a little stream, the form-sphere or formless-sphere kamma overpowers the sense-sphere kamma and remains after having made an opportunity (for its own results). The superior kamma, having prevented the sense-sphere kamma from producing its result, on its own leads to rebirth in the brahma world.",
