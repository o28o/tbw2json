    "sn22.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas at Suṁsumaragira in the Bhesakaḷa Grove, the Deer Park. Then the householder Nakulapita approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:[n.] The name means \"Nakula's father.\" His wife is called Nakulamata, \"Nakula's mother,\" though the texts never disclose the identity of Nakula. The Buddha pronounced him and his wife the most trusting(etadaggaṁ vissāsakānaṃ)of his lay disciplesAN.257(AN I 26). According toSpk, they had been the Blessed One's parents in five hundred past lives and his close relations in many more past lives. For additional references see DPPN 2:3 and Hecker, \"Shorter Lives of the Disciples,\" in Nyanaponika and Hecker,Great Disciples of the Buddha,pp. 375–78.",
    "sn22.1:2": "\"I am old, venerable sir, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, afflicted in body, often ill. I rarely get to see the Blessed One and the bhikkhus worthy of esteem.[n.] All three eds. of SN, and both eds. ofSpk, readaniccadassāvī,\"not always a seer,\" but the SS readingadhiccadassāvī,\"a chance seer,\" may be more original; CPD also prefers the latter. Spk: \"Because of my affliction I am unable to come whenever I want; I get to see (him) only sometimes, not constantly.\"Manobhāvanīyā,used in apposition tobhikkhū,has often been misinterpreted by translators to mean \"with developed mind.\" However, the expression is a gerundive meaning literally \"who should be brought to mind,\" i.e., who are worthy of esteem. Spk: \"Those great elders such as Sāriputta and Moggallana are called ‘worthy of esteem’ (‘to be brought to mind’) because the mind(citta)grows in wholesome qualities whenever they are seen.\"Let the Blessed One exhort me, venerable sir, let him instruct me, since that would lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.\"",
    "sn22.1:3": "\"So it is, householder, so it is! This body of yours is afflicted, weighed down, encumbered.[n.] Be and Se read the second descriptive term asaṇḍabhūto,lit. \"egg-become,\" andSpkendorses this with its explanation: \"Aṇḍabhūto:become weak(dubbala)like an egg. For just as one cannot play with an egg by throwing it around or hitting it—since it breaks apart at once—so this body has ‘become like an egg’ because it breaks apart even if one stumbles on a thorn or a stump.\" Despite the texts and Spk, Eeaddhabhūtomay be preferable; seeSN5.29and IV, n.14.If anyone carrying around this body were to claim to be healthy even for a moment, what is that due to other than foolishness? Therefore, householder, you should train yourself thus: ‘Even though I am afflicted in body, my mind will be unafflicted.’ Thus should you train yourself.\"",
    "sn22.1:4": "Then the householder Nakulapita, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement,sn.iii.2rose from his seat and, having paid homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he approached the Venerable Sāriputta. Having paid homage to the Venerable Sāriputta, he sat down to one side, and the Venerable Sāriputta then said to him:",
    "sn22.1:5–6": "\"Why not, venerable sir? Just now I was anointed by the Blessed One with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.\"",
    "sn22.1:7": "\"Didn’t it occur to you, householder, to question the Blessed One further as to how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mind, and how one is afflicted in body but not afflicted in mind?\"sn.iii.3",
    "sn22.1:8": "\"Then listen and attend closely, householder, I will speak.\"",
    "sn22.1:9": "\"How, householder, is one afflicted in body and afflicted in mind? Here, householder, the uninstructed worldling,[n.4] On the commentarial etymology ofputhujjana,see II, n.153.Spkgives a long analysis of this passage; for a translation of the parallel at Ps I 20–25, see Bodhi,Discourse on the Root of Existence,pp. 33–38. The commentaries distinguish between the \"uninstructed worldling\"(assutavā puthujjana)and the \"good worldling\"(kalyāṇa puthujjana). While both are worldlings in the technical sense that they have not reached the path of stream-entry, the former has neither theoretical knowledge of the Dhamma nor training in the practice, while the latter has both and is striving to reach the path.who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He lives obsessed by the notions: ‘I am form, form is mine.’[n.5] Text here enumerates the twenty types of identity view(sakkāyadiṭṭhi), obtained by positing a self in the four given ways in relation to the five aggregates that constitute personal identity (sakkāya; seeSN22.105). Identity view is one of the three fetters to be eradicated by the attainment of the path of stream-entry.Spk: He regards form as self(rūpaṁ attato samanupassati), by regarding form and the self as indistinguishable, just as the flame of an oil lamp and its colour are indistinguishable. He regards self as possessing form(rūpavantaṁ attānaṁ), when he takes the formless (i.e., the mind or mental factors) as a self that possesses form, in the way a tree possesses a shadow; form as in self(attani rūpaṁ), when he takes the formless (mind) as a self within which form is situated, as the scent is in a flower; self as in form(rūpasmiṁ attānaṁ), when he takes the formless (mind) as a self situated in form, as a jewel is in a casket. He is obsessed by the notions, \"I am form, form is mine\": he swallows these ideas with craving and views, takes his stand upon them, and grasps hold of them.Spk states that the identification of each aggregate individually with the self is the annihilationist view(ucchedadiṭṭhi), while the other views are variants of eternalism(sassatadiṭṭhi); thus there are five types of annihilationism and fifteen of eternalism. To my mind this is unacceptable, for eternalist views can clearly be formulated by taking the individual mental aggregates as the self. It also seems to me questionable that a view of self must implicitly posit one (or more) of the aggregates as self; for a view of self to have any meaning or content, it need only posit a relationship between a supposed self and the aggregates, but it need not identify one of the aggregates as self. According to the Buddha, all such positions collapse under analysis. See the \"considerations of self\" section of the Mahanidana Sutta (DN II 66–68), translated with commentary in Bodhi,The Great Discourse on Causation,pp. 53–55, 2–8.As he lives obsessed by these notions, that form of his changes and alters.
