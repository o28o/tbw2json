    "sn22.51:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees as impermanent form which is actually impermanent: that is his right view. Seeing rightly, he experiences revulsion. With the destruction of delight comes the destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes the destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is liberated and is said to be well liberated.[n.68]Spk: The mutual destruction of delight(nandi)and lust(rāga)is stated to show that in denotation there is actually no difference between them. Or, alternatively, one abandons delight by experiencing revulsion, , through the contemplation of revulsion(nibbidānupassanā); one abandons lust by becoming dispassionate, (which occurs) through the contemplation of dispassion(virāgānupassanā). To this extent, having set up insight (Spk-pṭ: with the phrase, \"with the destruction of delight comes the destruction of lust,\" which consummates the function of insight), by the phrase \"with the destruction of lust comes the destruction of delight\" he shows the path; and by the phrase \"with the destruction of delight and lust the mind is liberated\" the fruit is shown."
