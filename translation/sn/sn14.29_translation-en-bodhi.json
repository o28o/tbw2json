    "sn14.29:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, it is by way of elements that beings come together and unite. Those of wrong view …as abovesn.ii.69wrong concentration … wrong knowledge … wrong liberation come together and unite with those of wrong liberation.",
    "sn14.29:2": "\"Those of right view …as aboveright concentration … right knowledge … right liberation come together and unite with those of right liberation.\"[n.46]Spk: Those of wrong knowledge: those endowed with wrong reviewing(micchāpaccavekkhaṇenā samannāgatā). Those of wrong liberation: those who abide in an unemancipating liberation, which they assume to be wholesome liberation. Those of right knowledge: those with right reviewing. Those of right liberation: those endowed with the emancipating liberation of the fruit.Right knowledge and right liberation supplement the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. They are said to be factors of the arahant (e.g., atMN III 76,8), but atSN55.6(V 384,1–1) they are also ascribed to Anāthapiṇḍika, a stream-enterer. Spk's gloss of right knowledge as right reviewing knowledge is difficult to accept. More likely the expression refers to the full knowledge of the Four Noble Truths by means of which arahantship is gained."
