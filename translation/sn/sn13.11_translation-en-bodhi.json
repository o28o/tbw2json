    "sn13.11:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.ii.39\"Bhikkhus, suppose that a man would place on Sineru,[n.22] According to early Buddhist cosmology, Sineru is the mountain at the centre of our world-sphere; the word is the Pali counterpart of the better known Skt Meru. For a fuller picture of Buddhist cosmology, see Vism 205–7 (Ppn 7:40–44), and Ppn 7: n. 5.the king of mountains, seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans that have been placed there or Sineru, the king of mountains?\"",
    "sn13.11:2": "\"Venerable sir, Sineru, the king of mountains, is more. The seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans are trifling. They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of Sineru, the king of mountains.\"",
    "sn13.11:3": "\"So too, bhikkhus, the achievements of ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers of other sects do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the achievement of a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough. So great in achievement, bhikkhus, is a person accomplished in view, so great in direct knowledge.\"[n.222] Note that the ending here is different from the stock ending in the preceding suttas."
