    "sn2.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Kassapa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One.[n.4]Devaputtameans literally \"son of the devas,\" but since devas are depicted as arising in their celestial abodes by way of spontaneous birth, I translate the compound simply as \"young deva.\"Spk: They are reborn in the laps(anka)of devas. The males are called sons of the devas(devaputta); the females, daughters of the devas(devadhitaro). When they are not known by name it is said, \"a certain devata\" (as in the preceding saṁyutta); but those who are known by name are referred to as \"a son of the devas named So-and-So\" (as here). Spk-pṭ: This last statement is made only as a generalization, for the identity of several devatas is known.Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:",
    "sn2.1:2": "v.55\"He should train in well-spoken counsel,And in the exercise of an ascetic,In a solitary seat, alone,And in the calming of the mind.\"[n.144] Well-spoken counsel(subhasitassa).Spkinterprets this to mean that one should train oneself in just the fourfold good conduct of speech (see belowSN8.5; alsoMN I 88,1–), (and in talk) concerning the Four Noble Truths, the ten suitable topics of discussion (seeMN III 113,5–31), and the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment. It seems to me more likely the purport is that one should train in accordance with good counsel.Spkoffers two interpretations of samaṇupasana in pāda b: (i) that which is to be attended to by an ascetic, namely, one of the thirty-eight meditation subjects (see n.133); and (ii) attending upon an ascetic, i.e., serving learned bhikkhus in order to increase one's wisdom. The first seems more plausible. The calming of the mind(cittūpasama)is the training by way of the eight meditative attainments(aṭṭhasamāpatti).",
    "sn2.1:3": "This is what the young deva Kassapa said. The Teacher approved. Then the young deva Kassapa, thinking, \"The Teacher has approved of me,\" paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, he disappeared right there."
