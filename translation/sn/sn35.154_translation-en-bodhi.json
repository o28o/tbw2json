    "sn35.154:1": "Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it is said, ‘equipped with faculties, equipped with faculties.’[n.52]Indriyasampanno.Spk: Complete in faculties(paripunṇ̣indriyo). One who has attained arahantship by exploring with insight the six (sense) faculties is said to be \"complete in faculties\" because he possesses tamed faculties, or because he possesses the (spiritual) faculties of faith, etc., arisen by exploring with insight the six (sense) faculties, the eye, etc. For another interpretation of \"equipped with faculties,\" seeSN48.9.In what way, venerable sir, is one equipped with faculties?\"",
    "sn35.154:2": "\"If, bhikkhu, while one dwells contemplating rise and fall in the eye faculty, one experiences revulsion towards the eye faculty; if, while one dwells contemplating rise and fall in the ear faculty, one experiences revulsion towards the ear faculty; … if, while one dwells contemplating rise and fall in the mind faculty, one experiences revulsion towards the mind faculty, then, experiencing revulsion, one becomes dispassionate … . Whenthe mindis liberated, there comes the knowledge: ‘It's liberated.’ One understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’ It is in this way, bhikkhu, that one is equipped with faculties.\"sn.iv.141"
