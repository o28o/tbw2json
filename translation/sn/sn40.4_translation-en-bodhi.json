    "sn40.4:1": "… \"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the fourth jhāna, the fourth jhāna.\" What now is the fourth jhāna?’",
    "sn40.4:2": "\"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallana, Moggallana, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the fourth jhāna. Steady your mind in the fourth jhāna, unify your mind in the fourth jhāna, concentrate your mind in the fourth jhāna.’ Then, on a later occasion, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure,sn.iv.66I entered and dwelt in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity."
