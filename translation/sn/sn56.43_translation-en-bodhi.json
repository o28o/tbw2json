    "sn56.43:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there exists a hell named the Great Conflagration. There, whatever form one sees with the eye is undesirable,sn.v.45never desirable; unlovely, never lovely; disagreeable, never agreeable.[n.403]Mahāpariḷāho nāma nirayo.The description is also atSN35.35.Whatever sound one hears with the ear … Whatever odour one smells with the nose … Whatever taste one savours with the tongue … Whatever tactile object one feels with the body … Whatever mental phenomenon one cognizes with the mind is undesirable, never desirable; unlovely, never lovely; disagreeable, never agreeable.\"",
    "sn56.43:2": "When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: \"That conflagration, venerable sir, is indeed terrible; that conflagration is indeed very terrible. But is there, venerable sir, any other conflagration more terrible and frightful than that one?\"",
    "sn56.43:3": "\"But what, venerable sir, is that conflagration more terrible and frightful than that one?\"",
    "sn56.43:4": "\"But, bhikkhu, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not delight in volitional formations that lead to birth, nor in volitional formations that lead to aging, nor in volitional formations that lead to death, nor in volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Not delighting in such volitional formations, they do not generate volitional formations that lead to birth, nor generate volitional formations that lead to aging, nor generate volitional formations that lead to death, nor generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Not having generated such volitional formations, they are not burnt by the conflagration of birth, nor burnt by the conflagration of aging, nor burnt by the conflagration of death, nor burnt by the conflagration of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. They are freed from birth,sn.v.52aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; freed from suffering, I say.",
    "sn56.43:5": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’ … An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’\""
