    "sn35.13:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment,sn.iv.7while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: ‘What is the gratification, what is the danger, what is the escape in the case of the eye? What is the gratification, what is the danger, what is the escape in the case of the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind?’",
    "sn35.13:2": "\"So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these six internal sense bases, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I directly knew all this as it really is, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with … its devas and humans.[n.5]Spk: The \"internalness\" of the sense faculties should be understood as stemming from the strength of desire and lust for them. For people regard the six internal bases like the interior of a house, the six external bases like the house's vicinity. Just as the desire and lust of people are extremely strong in relation to what is inside the house and they don’t let anyone unknown enter, \nso is it in relation to the six internal bases. But as people's desire and lust are not so strong in relation to the house's vicinity, and they don’t forcibly prevent others from walking by, so is it in relation to the external sense bases.sn.iv.8"
