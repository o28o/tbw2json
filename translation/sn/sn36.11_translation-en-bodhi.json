    "sn36.11:1": "Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: \"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Three feeling have been spoken of by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These three feelings have been spoken of by the Blessed One. But the Blessed One has said: \"Whatever is felt is included in suffering.\" Now with reference to what was this stated by the Blessed One?’\"",
    "sn36.11:2": "\"Good, good, bhikkhu! These three feelings have been spoken of by me: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These three feelings have been spoken of by me. And I have also said: ‘Whatever is felt is included in suffering.’ That has been stated by me with reference to the impermanence of formations. That has been stated by me with reference to formations being subject to destruction … to formations being subject to vanishing … to formations being subject to fading awaysn.iv.17… to formations being subject to cessation … to formations being subject to change.[n.41]Spk: The impermanence of formations is itself the impermanence of feelings, and this impermanence is death. There is no suffering worse than death: with this intention it is said, \"All feeling is suffering.\"On this maxim, see tooSN1.3andMN136etc. Spk's explanation is not very cogent. The real reason all feeling is suffering is because all feeling is impermanent and thus cannot provide stable happiness and security."
