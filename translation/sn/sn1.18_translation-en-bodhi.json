    "sn1.18:1": "v.35\"Is there a person somewhere in the worldWho is restrained by a sense of shame,One who draws back from blameAs a good horse does from the whip?\"[n.28] Be and Se read the verbin pāda casapabodhati,Ee asappabodhati,Ee2 asappabodheti.Apparently the latter readings arose on the supposition that the word is formed froma+pabodh.Spk's gloss—apāhāranto bujjhati,\"who, pulling back, knows\"—supportsapabodhati(apa+bodh). The Skt parallel at Uv 9:5 has a different pāda altogether,sarvapapaṁ jahaty eṣa.Though the verse includes no ostensible interrogative, Spk interprets it as posing a question. I takekocito be equivalent to kvaci, though Spk glosses it as a personal pronoun. Spk: As a good thoroughbred who knows to pull back from the whip does not let it strike him, so a bhikkhu who is keen to avoid blame—who knows to pull back from it—does not let any genuine ground for abuse strike him. The deva asks: \"Is there any such arahant?\" But no one is wholly free from abuse on false grounds. The Buddha answers that such arahants, who avoid unwholesome states from a sense of shame, are few.",
    "sn1.18:2": "v.36\"Few are those restrained by a sense of shameWho fare always mindful;Few, having reached the end of suffering,Fare evenly amidst the uneven.\"sn.i.8"
