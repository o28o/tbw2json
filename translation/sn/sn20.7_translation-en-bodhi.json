    "sn20.7:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, once in the past the Dasarahas had a kettle drum called the Summoner.[n.367]Spk: The Dasarahas were a khattiya clan, so called because they took a tenth portion from a hundred (satato dasabhagaṁ gaṇhiṁsu—reference not clear). The Summoner(ānaka)was the name of a drum, made from the claw of a giant crab. It gave off a sound that could be heard for twelve yojanas all around and was therefore used to summon the people to assembly on festival days.When the Summoner became cracked, the Dasarahas inserted another peg.sn.ii.267Eventually the time came when the Summoner's original drumhead had disappeared and only a collection of pegs remained.",
    "sn20.7:2": "But when those discourses that are mere poetry composed by poets, beautiful in words and phrases, created by outsiders, spoken bytheirdisciples,[n.369]Spkglossessāvakabhāsitāastesaṁ tesaṁ sāvakehi bhāsitā,referring back to the outsiders(bāhiraka). Spk-pṭ clarifies: \"By the disciples of any of those who were not known as the Buddha’s disciples.\"are being recited, they will be eager to listen to them, will lend an ear to them, will apply their minds to understand them; and they will think those teachings should be studied and mastered. In this way, bhikkhus, those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata that are deep, deep in meaning, supramundane, dealing with emptiness, will disappear."
