    "sn45.159:1": "\"Bhikkhus, suppose there is a guest house.[n.42] As atSN36.4.People come from the east, west, north, and south and lodge there; khattiyas, brahmins,sn.v.52vessas, and suddas come and lodge there. So too, when a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, he fully understands by direct knowledge those things that are to be fully understood by direct knowledge; he abandons by direct knowledge those things that are to be abandoned by direct knowledge; he realizes by direct knowledge those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge; he develops by direct knowledge those things that are to be developed by direct knowledge.",
    "sn45.159:2": "\"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge? It should be said: the five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging â€¦ the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These are the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge."
