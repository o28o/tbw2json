    "sn3.5:1": "At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: \"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Who now protect themselves and who leave themselves unprotected?’ Then, venerable sir, it occurred to me: ‘Those who engage in misconduct of body, speech, and mind leave themselves unprotected. Even though a company of elephant troops may protect them, or a company of cavalry, or a company of chariot troops,sn.i.73or a company of infantry, still they leave themselves unprotected. For what reason? Because that protection is external, not internal; therefore they leave themselves unprotected. But those who engage in good conduct of body, speech, and mind protect themselves. Even though no company of elephant troops protects them, nor a company of cavalry, nor a company of charioteers, nor a company of infantry, still they protect themselves. For what reason? Because that protection is internal, not external; therefore they protect themselves.’\"",
    "sn3.5:2": "\"So it is, great king! So it is, great king!\"",
    "sn3.5:3": "v.89\"Good is restraint with the body,Restraint by speech is also good;Good is restraint with the mind,Restraint everywhere is good.Conscientious, everywhere restrained,One is said to be protected.\""
