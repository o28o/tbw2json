    "sn1.5:1": "At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devata recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn1.5:2": "v.7\"How many must one cut, how many abandon,And how many further must one develop?When a bhikkhu has surmounted how many tiesIs he called a crosser of the flood?\"",
    "sn1.5:3": "v.8\"One must cut off five, abandon five,And must develop a further five.A bhikkhu who has surmounted five tiesIs called a crosser of the flood.\"[n.12]Spk: One mustcut off(chinde)the five lower fetters (identity view, doubt, the distorted grasp of rules and vows, sensual desire, ill will). One must (abandon—jahe) the five higher fetters (lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance). In order to cut off and abandon these fettersone must develop a further five(pañca cuttari bhavaye),namely, the five spiritual faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom). The five ties(pañcasaṅga)are: lust, hatred, delusion, conceit, and views. A bhikkhu who has surmounted these five ties is calleda crosser of the flood(oghatiṇṇo),that is, a crosser of the fourfold flood.Strangely, although the verses refer to the five ties as if they are a standard doctrinal set, no pentad of saṅgas can be found as such in the Nikāyas; the fivesaṅgasare mentioned at Vibh 77,16–18."
