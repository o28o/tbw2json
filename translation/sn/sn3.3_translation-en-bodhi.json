    "sn3.3:1": "At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, for one who has taken birth, is there anything otherto expectthan aging and death?\"[n.205]Atthi nu kho bhante jatassa aññatra jaramaraṇa.Spk: He asks, \"Is there anyone who is free from aging and death?\"",
    "sn3.3:2": "v.384\"The beautiful chariots of kings wear out,This body too undergoes decay.But the Dhamma of the good does not decay:So the good proclaim along with the good.\"[n.07]Santo have sabbhi pavedayanti.Spkoffers three interpretations, of which only the first, which I follow, sounds plausible: \"The good, together with the good, declare: ‘The Dhamma of the good does not decay.’ The Dhamma of the good is Nibbāna; since that does not decay they call it unaging, deathless.\" The verse =Dhp 151, on which Dhp-a III 13,–5 comments: \"The ninefold Dhamma of the good—of the Buddhas, etc.—does not decay, does not undergo destruction. So the good—the Buddhas, etc.—proclaim this, declare it, along with the good, with the wise.\" The ninefold supramundane Dhamma is the four paths, their fruits, and Nibbāna. Brough argues thatsabbhihere must be understood to bear the sense of a dative, and he takes the point to be that \"the doctrine does not wear out ‘because good men teach it to other good men,’ their disciples and successors\" (p. 8, n. 160). I do not find his interpretation convincing, for the Dhamma-as-teaching must certainly decay, and only the supramundane Dhamma remains immune to aging and death."
