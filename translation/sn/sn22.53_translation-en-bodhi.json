    "sn22.53:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, one who is engaged is unliberated;[n.69] I readupayowith Be and Se, as against Eeupāyo.Here it seems the noun is being used as a virtual present participle.Spk: Engaged: one who has approached(upagato)the five aggregates by way of craving, conceit, and views.one who is disengaged is liberated. Consciousness, bhikkhus, while standing, might stand engaged with form; based upon form, established upon form, with a sprinkling of delight, it might come to growth, increase, and expansion. Or consciousness, while standing, might stand (engaged with feeling … engaged with perception …) engaged with volitional formations; based upon volitional formations, established upon volitional formations, with a sprinkling of delight, it might come to growth, increase, and expansion.[n.70] I translate in accordance with Se. Be and Ee have omitted the clauses onvedanāandsaññā,apparently an old scribal error. I also readnandūpasecana,with Be and Se, as against Eenandupasevana.Though Spk does not offer a gloss, the Be-Se reading can claim support from the underlying metaphor of vegetation, which is made explicit in the simile in the next sutta. In the similenandirāgais compared to the water element, and it is thus appropriate that it be \"sprinkled.\"The passage is quoted atDN III 228,6–3in explanation of the \"four stations of consciousness\"(catasso viññāṇaṭṭhitiyo); see too Nidd II . We find here still another indication of how consciousness grows and evolves in dependence on the other four aggregates. This sutta and the next should be compared with2:38–40,2:64, andSN22.3. As to why consciousness is not \"engaged\" with itself, see above n.9, which makes essentially the same point.",
    "sn22.53:2": "\"Bhikkhus, though someone might say: ‘Apart from form, apart from feeling, apart from perception, apart from volitional formations, I will make known the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and rebirth, its growth, increase, and expansion’—that is impossible.",
    "sn22.53:3": "\"Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu has abandoned lust for the form element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness.[n.71]Spk: The basis is cut off(vocchijjatārammaṇaṁ): the basis (or object) is cut off through the lack of any ability to precipitate rebirth. Spk-pṭ: The basis (or object), which is the condition for rebirth by way of the sign of kamma, etc., is \"cut off\" by way of (the cutting off of) the kamma that generates rebirth.Spk-pṭ thus takes arammaṇa here in the sense dominant in the Abhidhamma, i.e., as the object of rebirth-consciousness (see CMA :17). However, I understand the word in the older sense of \"basis,\" elsewhere glossed simply aspaccaya;see II, n.112. Spk's explanation need not entail the interpretation proposed by Spk-pṭ.If he has abandoned lust for the feeling element … for the perception element … for the volitional formations element … for the consciousness element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness."
