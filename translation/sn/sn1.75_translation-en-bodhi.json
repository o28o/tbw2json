    "sn1.75:1": "v.232\"Why are so many people here afraidWhen the path has been taught with many bases?[n.33]Maggo c’ anekayatanappavutto.Spk: He says, \"The path is explained by many methods(karaṇehi,)by way of the thirty-eight meditation objects. Such being the case, why have these people become frightened and grasped hold of the sixty-two views?\" The thirty-eight meditation objects(aṭṭhatiṁarammaṇa)are identical with the classical fortykammaṭṭhana(e.g., in Vism) except that the list of kasiṇas is drawn from the Nikāyas (e.g.,MN II 4,29–5,2), in which the last two (the spacekasiṇaand the consciousnesskasiṇa) are the same as the first two formless attainments(aruppa)and hence are not reckoned twice. In the Vism system these two are replaced by the limited spacekasiṇaand the lightkasiṇa, which brings the number up to forty.I ask you, O Gotama, broad of wisdom:On what should one take a standTo have no fear of the other world?\"",
    "sn1.75:2": "v.33\"Having directed speech and mind rightly,Doing no evil deeds with the body,Dwelling at home with ample food and drink,sn.i.43Faithful, gentle, generous, amiable:When one stands on these four things,Standing firmly on the Dhamma,One need not fear the other world.\"[n.134] The last line should be read with Be, Se, and Ee asdhamme ṭhito paralokaṁ na bhaye.Ee1 omitsdhamme ṭhito,apparently by oversight.Spkinterprets \"rightly directed speech and mind\" and \"doing no evil deeds with the body\" as the preliminary factors of purification, and takes the four qualities mentioned in pāda d to be the \"four things\" on which one should stand. But it also suggests another interpretation: right bodily, verbal, and mental conduct are the first three things, and the four qualities in pāda d taken together are the fourth. The first alternative sounds more plausible."
