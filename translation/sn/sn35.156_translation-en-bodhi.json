    "sn35.156:1": "\"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees as impermanent the eye which is actually impermanent: that is his right view.[n.54] This sutta and the next are parallel toSN22.5, but while the last sentence of the latter readscittaṁ vimuttaṁ suvimuttan ti vuccati,the present one has simplycittaṁ suvimuttan ti vuccati.Seeing rightly, he experiences revulsion. With the destruction of delight comes destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated."
