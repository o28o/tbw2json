    "sn47.6:1": "\"Bhikkhus, once in the past a hawk suddenly swooped down and seized a quail.[n.30] The parable of the hawk and the quail is also related in the Sakuṇagghi Jataka (No. 68; Ja II 58–59), with the Bodhisatta as the quail and Devadatta as the hawk. For additional references, see KS 5:25, n. . Thoughsakuṇagghiis a feminine, this need not imply the hawk is female.Ajjhapattāis a reduplicated aorist which, in the Pali tradition, became transformed into a past participle; see von Hinüber, \"Traces of the Reduplicated Aorist in Pali,\" inSelected Papers,pp. 52–6. The conjunction of two finite verbs here seems hard to account for, as normally an absolutive would precede a finite verb.Then, while the quail was being carried off by the hawk, he lamented: ‘We were so unlucky, of so little merit! We strayed out of our own resort into the domain of others. If we had stayed in our own resort today, in our own ancestral domain, this hawk wouldn’t have stood a chance against me in a fight.’ - ‘But what is your own resort, quail, what is your own ancestral domain?’ - ‘The freshly ploughed field covered with clods of soil.’sn.v.47",
    "sn47.6:2": "\"Then, bhikkhus, the quail went to a freshly ploughed field covered with clods of soil. Having climbed up on a large clod, he stood there and addressed the hawk: ‘Come get me now, hawk! Come get me now, hawk!’",
    "sn47.6:3": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, do not stray outside your own resort into the domain of others. Māra will gain access to those who stray outside their own resort into the domain of others; Māra will get a hold on them.[n.12] Cp.SN5.24(IV 185,7–15; 186,2–0).sn.v.148",
    "sn47.6:4": "\"Move in your own resort, bhikkhus, in your own ancestral domain. Māra will not gain access to those who move in their own resort, in their own ancestral domain; Māra will not get a hold on them."
