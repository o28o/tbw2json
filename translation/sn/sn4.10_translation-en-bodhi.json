    "sn4.10:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "sn4.10:2": "\"Bhikkhus, this life span of human beings is short. One has to go on to the future life. One should do what is wholesome and lead the holy life; for one who has taken birth there is no avoiding death. One who lives long, bhikkhus, lives a hundred years or a little longer.\"",
    "sn4.10:3": "Then Māra the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:sn.i.109",
    "sn4.10:4": "v.65\"The days and nights do not fly by,Life does not come to a stop.The life span of mortals rolls alongLike the chariot's felly round the hub.\"[n.280] The point may be that as the felly revolves around the stable hub, so the changing forms of life revolve around the stable soul or life-principle. The verse seems to be alluding to a simile in the Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upaniṣad II.5.15: \"And as all spokes are contained in the axle and in the felly of a wheel, all beings, and all those selves (of the earth, water, etc.), are contained in that Self\" (Müller,The Upanishads,2:116). See too Chandogya Upaniṣad VII.15.1(The Upanishads,1:120).",
    "sn4.10:5": "v.466\"The days and nights go flying by,Life comes to a stop.The life span of mortals is depletedLike the water in rivulets.\"",
    "sn4.10:6": "Then Māra the Evil One … disappeared right there."
