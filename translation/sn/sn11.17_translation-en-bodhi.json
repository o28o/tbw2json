    "sn11.17:1": "At Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had gone for his day's abiding and was in seclusion. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, and Brahma Sahampati approached the Blessed One and stood one at each doorpost. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn11.17:2": "v.918\"Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!Your burden lowered, debt-free one, wander in the world.Your mind is fully liberatedLike the moon on the fifteenth night.\"[n.648]Spk: Your burden lowered(pannabharo): He has put down the burden of the aggregates, the defilements, and the volitional formations. The fifteenth of the bright lunar fortnight is the full-moon night.sn.i.34",
    "sn11.17:3": "Brahma Sahampati:\"It is not in such a way that the Tathāgatas are to be venerated, lord of the devas. The Tathāgatas are to be venerated thus:",
    "sn11.17:4": "v.919\"Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!O caravan leader, debt-free one, wander in the world.Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:There will be those who will understand.\"[n.69] The verse is identical with his entreaty at v.560. NeitherSpknor Spk-pṭ explains why Brahma Sahampati corrects Sakka. The reason may be that Sakka praises only those qualities of the Buddha that he shares with other arahants, while Brahma addresses him in his role as sattha, the Teacher and Master of the dispensation. The same exchange of verses, between Śakra and Mahābrahmā, is recorded at Mvu III 315–16, but set at the Goatherd's Banyan Tree in the period immediately following the Buddha’s enlightenment; see Jones, 3:30–5."
