    "sn24.37:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what is present …sn.iii.29… does such a view as this arise: ‘The self consists of form and is unimpaired after death’?\" …[n.266] The next eight views are varieties of eternalism with regard to the after-death condition of the self. They are also mentioned atDN I 3,6–5. For a translation of the commentary, see Bodhi,All-Embacing Net of Views,pp. 76–82.Spk: The view of a self consisting of form arises from taking the object alone (Spk-pṭ: thekasiṇa) as self; a formless self, from taking the jhāna as self; the syncretic view, from taking both object and jhāna as self; the double negation, from mere reasoning(takkamattena). The view of the self as exclusively happy arises in the meditator, the rationalist, and those who remember past births. The same for those who view the self as exclusively miserable, etc."
