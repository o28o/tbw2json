    "sn12.55:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can be clung to, craving increases. With craving as condition, clingingcomes to be… . Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.",
    "sn12.55:2": "\"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree, and all its roots going downwards and across would send the sap upwards. Sustained by that sap, nourished by it, that great tree would stand for a very long time. So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can be clung to, craving increases … . Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.[n.148]Spk: The great tree represents the round of existence with its three planes; the roots, the sense bases; the sending up of the sap through the roots, the building up of kamma through the six sense doors; the stability of the tree, the blind worldling's long continuation in saṁsara as he repeatedly sustains the round by building up kamma.sn.ii.88",
    "sn12.55:3": "\"When, bhikkhus, one dwells contemplating danger in things that can be clung to, craving ceases. With the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging … . Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.",
    "sn12.55:4": "\"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree. Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the tree at its foot, dig it up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and root-fibre. He would cut the tree into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and collect the ashes. Having done so, he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. Thus that great tree would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising."
