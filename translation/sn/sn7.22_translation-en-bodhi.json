    "sn7.22:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans where there was a town of the Sakyans named Khomadussa.[n.482] The name Khomadussa means \"linen cloth.\"Spksays that the town was given this name because of the prevalence of linen there. From what follows it seems the town was a brahmin enclave in the predominantly khattiya Sakyan republic. In the irate reaction of the brahmins to the Buddha’s arrival on the scene we can detect a note of hostility rooted in caste prejudice.Then the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Khomadussa for alms.",
    "sn7.22:2": "v.706\"That is no council where the good are absent;They are not the good who don’t speak Dhamma.But having abandoned lust, hate, and delusion,Those speaking on Dhamma are alone the good.\"",
    "sn7.22:3": "When this was said, the brahmin householders of Khomadussa said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama, as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Let Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life.\""
