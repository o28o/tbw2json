    "sn17.12:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . Bhikkhus, I have known of a certain person here whose mind I have encompassed with my own mind: ‘This venerable one would not tell a deliberate lie even for the sake of a silver bowl filled with powdered gold.’ Yet some time later I see him, his mind overcome and obsessed by gain, honour, and praise, telling a deliberate lie. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
