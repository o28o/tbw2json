    "sn4.22:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at sīlavati . Now on that occasion the Venerable Samiddhi was dwelling not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute.[n.305] Samiddhi has already appeared atSN.20.Then, while the Venerable Samiddhi was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind thus: \"It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that my teacher is the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that I have gone forth in this well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline! It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that my companions in the holy life are virtuous, of good character!\"",
    "sn4.22:2": "Then the Venerable Samiddhi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened.",
    "sn4.22:3": "The Blessed One said:\"That was not the earth splitting open, Samiddhi. That was Māra the Evil One, who had come in order to confound you. Go back, Samiddhi, and dwell diligent, ardent, and resolute.\"",
    "sn4.22:4": "v.89\"I have gone forth out of faithFrom the home to the homeless life.My mindfulness and wisdom are mature,And my mind well concentrated.Conjure up whatever forms you wish,But you will never make me tremble.\"[n.307] The verse =Th 6, Samiddhi's sole stanza. I understand buddha in pāda b to be simply a variant spelling ofvuḍḍha(the reading atTh 6), thoughSpkglosses buddha here asñata,to which Spk-pṭ adds:Ta ariyamaggena jananasamatthanabhavena avabuddha;\"They have been comprehended by the noble path through its capacity for knowledge.\"",
    "sn4.22:5": "Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, \"The bhikkhu Samiddhi knows me,\" sad and disappointed, disappeared right there."
