    "sn45.179:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these five lower fetters.[n.49] These are the fetters that bind beings to the sense-sphere realm(kāmadhātu). The first three are eradicated by the stream-enterer and the once-returner, all five by the nonreturner.What five? Identity view, doubt, the distorted grasp of rules and vows, sensual desire, ill will. These are the five lower fetters. This Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these five lower fetters, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.\""
