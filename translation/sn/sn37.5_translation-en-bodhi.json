    "sn37.5:1": "Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One … and said to him:[n.263] I follow the arrangement of Be, which includes the opening paragraph under the fifth sutta of this vagga and records37:5–24as addressed solely to Anuruddha. Ee places the introductory paragraph here (and in \"The Bright Side\") before the first sutta of each series. In this respect Se corresponds with Be. In Se, however, only the first sutta in each series, dark and bright, is addressed to Anuruddha. Se then repeats the same sutta but addressed to the bhikkhus, and then records the following suttas in each series as addressed solely to the bhikkhus. For this reason Se winds up with two suttas more than Be and Ee, namely, the two addressed only to Anuruddha. These suttas lackyebhuyyena,\"generally (reborn),\" found in the preceding sutta.Anuruddha excelled in the exercise of the divine eye, which discerns the passing away and rebirth of beings, and also seems to have had frequent encounters with women, both human and celestial (seeSN9.6). For a biographical sketch, see Hecker, \"Anuruddha: Master of the Divine Eye,\" in Nyanaponika and Hecker,Great Disciples of the Buddha,pp. 85–20.\"Here, venerable sir, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I see women, with the breakup of the body, after death, being reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell. When a woman possesses how many qualities, venerable sir, is she reborn thus?\"",
    "sn37.5:2": "\"When, Anuruddha, a woman possesses five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell. What five?"
