    "sn1.9:1": "At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devata recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn1.9:2": "v.15\"There is no taming here for one fond of conceit,Nor is there sagehood for the unconcentrated:Though dwelling alone in the forest, heedless,One cannot cross beyond the realm of Death.\"[n.16]Spk: Here taming(dama)signifies the qualities pertaining to concentration. Sagehood(mona)is the knowledge of the four supramundane paths, so called because it experiences(munati ti monaṁ>); that is, it knows the four truths. The realm of Death(maccudheyya)is the round with its three planes, so called because it is the domain of Death; itsbeyondorfar shore(para)is Nibbāna.",
    "sn1.9:3": "v.16\"Having abandoned conceit, well concentrated,With lofty mind, everywhere released:While dwelling alone in the forest, diligent,One can cross beyond the realm of Death.\"[n.17]Spksees this couplet as an implicit formulation of the threefold training: by the abandoning of conceit the higher virtue(adhisīla)is implied; by well concentrated(susamahitatto), the training in concentration or the higher mind(adhicitta); and by lofty mind(sucetaso), denoting a mind endowed with wisdom, the training in the higher wisdom(adhipañña). To this we might add that the last phrase, everywhere released(sabbadhi vippamutto), points to the culmination of the threefold training in liberation(vimutti). SeeDN2.sn.i.5"
