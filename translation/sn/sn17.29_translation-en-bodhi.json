    "sn17.29:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . Gain, honour, and praise cut through the outer skin, then through the inner skin, then through the flesh, then through the sinews, then through the bone. Having cut through the bone, they reach right to the marrow.",
    "sn17.29:2": "Suppose, bhikkhus, a strong man would wrap one's leg with a taut horsehair rope and pull it tight. It would cut through the outer skin, then through the inner skin, then through the flesh, then through the sinews, then through the bone. Having cut through the bone, it would reach right to the marrow. So too, bhikkhus, gain, honour, and praise cut through the outer skin … they reach right to the marrow. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
