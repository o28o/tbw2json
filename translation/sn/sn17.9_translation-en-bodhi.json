    "sn17.9:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . Bhikkhus, high in the sky winds called gales are blowing.[n.323]Verambhavātā.Spk: A strong type of wind, discerned at a height from which the four continents appear the size of lotus leaves.If a bird goes up there, the gale winds fling it about, and as it is flung about by the gale winds, its feet go one way, its wings another way, its head still another way, and its body still another way. So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu here whose mind is overcome and obsessed by gain, honour, and praise dresses in the morning and, taking bowl and robe, enters a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without setting up mindfulness, unrestrained in his sense faculties. He sees women there lightly clad or lightly attired and lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust he gives up the training and returns to the lower life. Some take his robe, others his bowl, others his sitting cloth, and still others his needle case, as with the bird flung by the gale winds. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
