    "sn47.10:1": "Then in the morning the Venerable Ānanda dressed and, taking bowl and robe, he approached the bhikkhunis’ quarters and sat down in the appointed seat. Then a number of bhikkhunis approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:",
    "sn47.10:2": "\"Here, Venerable Ānanda, a number of bhikkhunis, dwelling with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, perceive successively loftier stages of distinction.\"[n.144] I read with Be and Se,uḷāraṃ pubbenāparaṁ visesaṃ sañjānanti.Ee readssampajānanti.Spkexplains \"successively loftier stages of distinction\" by way of the successive stages of wisdom, from the comprehension of the four primary elements through the ascription of the three characteristics to all formations.sn.v.155",
    "sn47.10:3–4": "Then the Venerable Ānanda instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened those bhikkhunis with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and left. Then the Venerable Ānanda walked for alms in Sāvatthī. When he had returned from the alms round, after his meal he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported all that had happened.The Blessed One said:",
    "sn47.10:5": "\"So it is, Ānanda, so it is! It may be expected of anyone, Ānanda—whether bhikkhu or bhikkhuni—who dwells with a mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, that such a one will perceive successively loftier stages of distinction.",
    "sn47.10:6": "\"What four? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.sn.v.15While he is contemplating the body in the body, there arises in him, based on the body, either a fever in the body or sluggishness of mind, or the mind is distracted outwardly. That bhikkhu should then direct his mind towards some inspiring sign.[n.145]Spk: A fever of defilement(kilesapariḷāha)arises having made the body its basis(ārammaṇa). When this happens, one should not let oneself become excited by the defilement but \"should then direct the mind to some inspiring sign\"(kismiñcideva pasādaniye nimitte cittaṃ paṇidahitabbaṁ), that is, one should place the meditating mind on some object that inspires confidence, such as the Buddha, etc.When he directs his mind towards some inspiring sign, gladness is born. When he is gladdened, rapture is born. When the mind is uplifted by rapture, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. The mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated. He reflects thus: ‘The purpose for the sake of which I directed my mind has been achieved. Let me now withdraw it.’[n.14] Spk: \"Let me withdraw it from the inspiring object and redirect it towards the original meditation object.\"So he withdraws the mind and does not think or examine. He understands: ‘Without thought and examination, internally mindful, I am happy.’[n.147] Spk explains this to mean that he is \"without defiled thought, without defiled examination,\" but the absence ofvitakkaandvicāraseems to imply he has reached the second jhāna. See tooMN III 13,20–29, where the foursatipaṭṭhānasdo service for the first jhāna, and the Buddha also enjoins the practice of the four without thought and examination, hence in the mode of the second jhāna.",
    "sn47.10:7": "\"Again, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he is contemplating phenomena in phenomena, there arises in him, based on phenomena, either a fever in the body or sluggishness of mind, or the mind is distracted outwardly. That bhikkhu should then direct his mind towards some inspiring sign. When he directs his mind towards some inspiring sign … He understands: ‘Without thought and examination, internally mindful, I am happy.’",
    "sn47.10:8": "\"And how, Ānanda, is there development without direction? Not directing his mind outwardly, a bhikkhu understands: ‘My mind is not directed outwardly.’ Then he understands: ‘It is unconstricted after and before, liberated, undirected.’[n.149]Spkgives various explanations of \"unconstricted after and before\"(pacchā pure asaṅkhittaṁ). SeeSN51.20(V 277,29–27,4) and n.272below.Then he further understands: ‘I dwell contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful; I am happy.’",
    "sn47.10:9": "\"Thus, Ānanda, I have taught development by direction, I have taught development without direction. Whatever should be done, Ānanda, by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, desiring their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, Ānanda, these are empty huts. Meditate, Ānanda, do not be negligent, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you.\"",
    "sn47.10:10": "This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, the Venerable Ānanda delighted in the Blessed One's statement."
