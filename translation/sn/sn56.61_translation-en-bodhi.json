    "sn56.61:1": "Then the Blessed One took up a little bit of soil in his fingernail and addressed the bhikkhus thus:",
    "sn56.61:2": "\"So too, bhikkhus, those beings are few who are reborn among human beings. But those beings are more numerous who are reborn elsewhere than among human beings.[n.414] This is also atAN1.334, but without the connection to the Four Noble Truths.For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, they have not seen the Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.",
    "sn56.61:3": "\"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’ … An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’\""
