    "sn35.240:1": "\"Bhikkhus, in the past a tortoise[n.84] Text uses both words,kummo kacchapo.SeeSN7:3.was searching for food along the bank of a river one evening. On that same evening a jackal was also searching for food along the bank of that same river. When the tortoise saw the jackal in the distance searching for food,sn.iv.78it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell and passed the time keeping still and silent.[n.85]Apposukko tuṇhı̄bhūto saṅkasāyati.As atSN2:4.",
    "sn35.240:2": "\"So too, bhikkhus, Māra the Evil One is constantly and continually waiting close by you, thinking, ‘Perhaps I will gain access to him through the eye or through the ear … or through the mind.’ Therefore, bhikkhus, dwell guarding the doors of the sense faculties. Having seen a form with the eye, do not grasp its signs and features. Since, if you leave the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the eye faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear … Having smelt an odour with the nose … Having savoured a taste with the tongue … Having felt a tactile object with the body … Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, do not grasp its signs and features. Since, if you leave the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.",
    "sn35.240:3": "Drawing in the mind's thoughtsAs a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell,Independent, not harassing others, fully quenched,A bhikkhu would not blame anyone.[n.186] The verse = I, v.4. As the verse is not preceded by the usual sentence stating that the Buddha spoke it on this occasion, it seems the redactors of the canon have tacked it on by reason of the tortoise simile."
