    "sn4.4:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"[n.269] This discourse is also at Vin I 22, 24–36, set soon after the Buddha’s first rains residence at the Deer Park in Isipatana. The Buddha had already sent out his first sixty arahant disciples to spread the Dhamma. The present admonition, it seems, is addressed to the newly ordained bhikkhus who had come to the Buddha in response to the missionary work of the first disciples.",
    "sn4.4:2": "\"Bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, I have arrived at unsurpassed liberation, I have realized unsurpassed liberation. You too, bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, must arrive at unsurpassed liberation, must realize unsurpassed liberation.\"[n.70]Spk: Careful attention(yoniso manasikara)is attention that is the right means(upayamanasikara). Careful right striving(yoniso sammappadhana)is energy that is the right means, energy that is the causal basis(upayaviriya karaṇaviriya). Unsurpassed liberation(anuttaravimutti)is liberation of the fruit of arahantship. On the role of careful attention, seeSN46.51. Right striving is the fourfold right effort; seeSN45.8,SN49.1.",
    "sn4.4:3": "v.452\"You are bound by Māra's snareBoth celestial and human;You are bound by Māra's bondage:You won’t escape me, ascetic!\"[n.271]Spk: Māra's snare(marapasa)is the snare of the defilements, that is, the celestial and human cords of sensual pleasure.",
