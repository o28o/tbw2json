    "sn35.69:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Upasena were dwelling at Rājagaha in the Cool Grove, in the Snake's Hood Grotto.[n.3] Upasena was Sāriputta's younger brother. His verses are atTh 577–86.Spkexplains that the grotto was called \"Snake's Hood Grotto\"(sappasonḍikapabbhara)because of its shape.Now on that occasion a viper had fallen on the Venerable Upasena's body. Then the Venerable Upasena addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff.\"[n.32] Spk: After his meal the elder had taken his large robe and was sitting in the shade of the cave doing some sewing. At that moment two young vipers were playing in the thatch over the cave; one fell and landed on the elder's shoulder. Its mere touch was poisonous, and the poison spread over the elder's body. He addressed the bhikkhus thus so that his body would not perish inside the cave.",
    "sn35.69:2": "When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Upasena: \"We do not see any alteration in the Venerable Upasena's body nor any change in his faculties; yet the Venerable Upasena says: ‘Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff.’\"",
    "sn35.69:3": "\"It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Upasena for a long time that it does not occur to him, ‘I am the eye’ or ‘The eye is mine’; ‘I am the ear’ or ‘The ear is mine’ … ‘I am the mind’ or ‘The mind is mine.’\""
