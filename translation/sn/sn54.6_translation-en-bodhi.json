But as to how mindfulness of breathing is fulfilled in detail, Ariṭṭha, listen and attend closely, I will speak.\"[n.94]Spk: Ariṭṭha had explained his own (attainment of) the nonreturner's path (Spk-pṭ: because he spoke obliquely of the eradication of the five lower fetters), but the Buddha explained the insight practice to gain the path of arahantship.",
    "sn54.6:3": "\"And how, Ariṭṭha, is mindfulness of breathing fulfilled in detail? Here, Ariṭṭha, a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down.

He trains thus: ‘Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe in’; he trains thus: ‘Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe out.’"
