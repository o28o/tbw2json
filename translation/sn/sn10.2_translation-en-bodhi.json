    "sn10.2:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the yakkha Sakkanamaka approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:",
    "sn10.2:2": "v.805\"Having abandoned all the knotsAs one fully released,It isn’t good for you, an ascetic,To be instructing others.\"[n.561]Spk: This yakkha, it is said, belonged to Māra's faction(mārapakkhika-yakkha). His verse parallels Māra's reproach to the Buddha at v.474, and the Buddha’s reply echoes v. 475. Spk-pṭ explains the purport to be that the wise man's compassion and sympathy are not tainted by worldly affection.",
    "sn10.2:3": "v.806\"If, O Sakka, for some reasonIntimacy with anyone should arise,The wise man ought not to stir his mindWith compassion towards such a person.",
    "sn10.2:4": "v.807\"But if with a mind clear and pureHe gives instructions to others,He does not become fetteredBy his compassion and sympathy.\"[n.562]Spkglossesvaṇṇenawithkāraṇena(as in v.796c; see n.555), and Spk-pṭ glossesyena kena ciwithgāhaṭṭhena vā pabbajitena vā,\"with a householder or one gone forth,\" thus separating it fromvaṇṇenaand treating it as an expression of personal reference. The purport of the Buddha’s verses is that a wise man should not take to instructing others if he is at risk of becoming attached, but he may do so out of compassion when his mind is purified and his sympathy is not tainted by worldly affection.sn.i.207"
