    "sn22.146:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, for a clansman who has gone forth out of faith, this is what accords with the Dhamma: he should dwell engrossed in revulsion towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness.[n.228] SeeSN22.39and n.52.One who dwells engrossed in revulsion towards form … towards consciousness, fully understands form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. One who fully understands form … consciousness is freed from form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. He is freed from birth, aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; freed from suffering, I say.\""
