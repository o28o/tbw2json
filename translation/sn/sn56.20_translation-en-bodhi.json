    "sn56.20:1": "\"Bhikkhus, these four things are actual, unerring, not otherwise.[n.385]Tathāni avitathāni anaññathāni.SeeSN2.20.Spk: \"Actual in the sense of not departing from the real nature of things; for suffering is stated to be just suffering. Unerring, because of the nonfalsification of its real nature; for suffering does not become nonsuffering. Not otherwise, because of not arriving at a different nature; for suffering does not arrive at the nature of the origin (of suffering), etc. The same method for the other truths.\" I understand anaññatha in the simpler and more straightforward sense that the truths are \"not otherwise\" than the way things really are.What four?",
    "sn56.20:2": "\"Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’ … An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’\""
