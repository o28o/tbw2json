    "sn1.29:1": "v.74\"Having four wheels and nine doors,Filled up and bound with greed,Born from a bog, O great hero!How does one escape from it?\"[n.55]Spk: The four wheels are the four modes of deportment (walking, standing, sitting, lying down). The nine doors are the nine \"wound openings\" (eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, genitals, anus). It is filled up with impure body parts (head-hairs, etc.), and bound with greed, i.e., with craving. How does one escape from it?: How can there be emergence from such a body? How can there be freedom, release, a transcendence of it? Spk-pṭ adds: It is born from a bog(pankajata)because it is produced in the foul bog of the mother's womb. The Pali expression could also have been rendered, \"It is a bog,\" but I follow Spk-pṭ. This stark perspective on the body is elaborated atSn I, , pp. 34–35.",
    "sn1.29:2": "v.75\"Having cut the thong and the strap,Having cut off evil desire and greed,Having drawn out craving with its root:Thus one escapes from it.\"[n.56] in pāda a (=Dhp 398a), Ee1 nandiṁ should be amended to naddhiṁ.Spkexplains that in the Dhp verse varatta is craving(taṇhā), but as craving is mentioned separately in our verse, varatta is glossed differently here. Spk: The thong(naddhi)is hostility(upanaha), i.e., strong anger; the strap(varatta)is the remaining defilements. Desire and greed refer to the same mental state spoken of in two senses: desire(iccha)is the preliminary weak stage, or the desire for what has not been obtained; greed(lobha)is the subsequent strong stage, or the holding to an acquired object. Craving with its root: with its root of ignorance."
