    "sn10.6:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Anuruddha, having risen at the first flush of dawn, was reciting stanzas of Dhamma. Then the female yakkha Piyaṅkara's Mother hushed her little child thus:[n.579] Spk: She had taken her son Piyaṅkara on her hip and was searching for food behind Jeta’s Grove when she heard the sweet sound of the elder’s recitation. The sound went straight to her heart and, transfixed, she stood there listening to the Dhamma, her interest in food gone. But her little son was too young to appreciate the recitation and kept complaining to his mother about his hunger.",
