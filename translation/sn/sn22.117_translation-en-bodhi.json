This is called, bhikkhus, an uninstructed worldling who is bound by bondage to form, who is bound by inner and outer bondage, who does not see the near shore and the far shore, who grows old in bondage,[n.223] I follow Be, which readsbaddho jīyati,as against Se and Ee, which havebāddho jayati,\"who is born in bondage.\"who dies in bondage, who in bondage goes from this world to the other world.sn.iii.65",
    "sn22.117:2": "\"But, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple … does not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. This is called, bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple who is not bound by bondage to form, who is not bound by inner and outer bondage, who sees the near shore and the far shore. He is freed from suffering, I say."
