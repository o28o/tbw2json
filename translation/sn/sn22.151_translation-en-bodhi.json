    "sn22.151:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what,[n.23]Kiṁ abhinivissa.Spk:Kiṁ abhinivisitvā;paccayaṁ katva ti attho. Spk, it seems, does not see abhinivissa as contributing anything more to the meaning than a synonym forupādāya,but the question then arises why it should be added in the case of views but not in the case of pleasure and pain. Abhinivissa is an absolutive related to the nounabhinivesa,\"adherence,\" which implies an element of interpretation, namely, interpretation of experience through the lens of a wrong view. When this is acknowledged, we can then see thatabhinivissasuggests the imposition of a cognitive interpretation on the aggregates, which goes beyond the bare conative clinging implied byupādāya.does one regard things thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?\""
