    "sn12.23:1": "At Sāvatthī.[n.67] For an essay based on this important sutta, see Bodhi,Transcendental Dependent Arising.The opening paragraph recurs atSN22.0, but with a different sequel; see too n.58.Spkstates that the destruction of the taints(āsavakkhaya)is arahantship, which gains this name because it arises at the end of the destruction of the taints(āsavānaṁ khayante jatatta).\"Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. For one who knows what, for one who sees what, does the destruction of the taints come about? ‘Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling … such is perception … such are volitional formations … such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away’: it is for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the destruction of the taints comes about.sn.ii.30",
    "sn12.23:2": "\"I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge of destruction? It should be said: liberation.[n.68]Spk: Having set up the teaching with its climax in arahantship, the Buddha next shows the preliminary practice along which the arahant has travelled. The knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction(khayasmiṁ khaye ñāṇaṁ)is the reviewing knowledge(paccavekkhaṇañāṇa)which occurs when the destruction of the taints—namely, arahantship—has been obtained (see I, n.376and Vism 676; Ppn :19–1). Liberation is the liberation of the fruit of arahantship(arahattaphalavimutti), which is a condition for reviewing knowledge by way of decisive-support condition(upanissayapaccaya). First the fruit of arahantship arises, then the knowledge of destruction.Spk glossessa-upanisāassakāraṇa, sappacayya,\"with cause, with condition.\" Spk-pṭ adds:upanisīdati phalaṁ ettha ti kāraṇaṁ upanīsa;\"the cause is called the proximate cause because the effect rests upon it.\" Thus the commentators take upanisā to be the equivalent of Skt upaniṣad, not a contraction of upanissaya. Although, as CPD points out, \"a semantic blend\" with the latter takes place, the two words must be kept distinct because not everything that is anupanisā(proximate cause) for other things is anupanissayapaccaya(decisive support condition) for those things. The latter refers solely to something which plays a strong causal role.",
    "sn12.23:3": "And what is the proximate cause for concentration? It should be said: happiness.",
    "sn12.23:4": "And what is the proximate cause for faith? It should be said: suffering.[n.69]Spkglosses the terms in the above sequence thus (starting from the end): Suffering is the suffering of the round(vaṭṭadukkha). Faith is repeatedly arising faith (aparāparaṁ uppajjanasaddhā;that is, tentative faith, not the unwavering faith of a noble disciple). Gladness(pāmojja)is weak rapture, while rapture proper(pīti)is strong rapture. Tranquillity(passaddhi)is the subsiding of distress, a condition for the happiness preliminary to absorption. Happiness is the happiness in the preliminary phase of meditative absorption, concentration the jhāna used as a basis (for insight;pādakajjhanasamādhi). Knowledge and vision of things as they really are(yathābhūtañāṇadassana)is weak insight, namely, the knowledges of the discernment of formations, of the overcoming of doubt, of exploration, and of what is and what is not the path (see Vism chaps. 18–20). Revulsion(nibbidā)is strong insight, namely, knowledge of appearance as fearful, of contemplation of danger, of reflection, and of equanimity about formations (Vism 65–57; Ppn 21:29–66). Dispassion(virāga)is the path, which arises expunging defilements.Note that in the next paragraph suffering replaces aging-and-death of the usual formula.",
    "sn12.23:5": "And what is the proximate cause for craving? It should be said: feeling.",
    "sn12.23:6": "\"Thus, bhikkhus, with ignorance as proximate cause, volitional formationscome to be; with volitional formations as proximate cause, consciousness; with consciousness as proximate cause, name-and-form; with name-and-form as proximate cause, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as proximate cause, contact; with contact as proximate cause, feeling; with feeling as proximate cause, craving; with craving as proximate cause, clinging; with clinging as proximate cause, existence; with existence as proximate cause, birth; with birth as proximate cause, suffering; with suffering as proximate cause, faith; with faith as proximate cause, gladness; with gladness as proximate cause, rapture; with rapture as proximate cause, tranquillity; with tranquillity as proximate cause, happiness; with happiness as proximate cause, concentration; with concentration as proximate cause, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are;sn.ii.32with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as proximate cause, revulsion; with revulsion as proximate cause, dispassion; with dispassion as proximate cause, liberation; with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.",
    "sn12.23:7": "\"Just as, bhikkhus, when rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountain top, the water flows down along the slope and fills the cleft, gullies, and creeks; these being full fill up the pools; these being full fill up the lakes; these being full fill up the streams; these being full fill up the rivers; and these being full fill up the great ocean;[n.0] The simile also occurs atSN55.38,AN I 243,2–32, andAN V 114,6–14.",
    "sn12.23:8": "So too, with ignorance as proximate cause, volitional formationscome to be; with volitional formations as proximate cause, consciousness … with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.\""
