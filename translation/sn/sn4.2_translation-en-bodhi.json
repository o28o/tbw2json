    "sn4.2:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvela on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened.sn.i.04Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open air in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling.[n.266]Devo ca ekam ekaṁ phusayati.I understand this idiom (which recurs atSN6.3andSN7.22) to mean that rain was falling drop by drop, not that it was falling continuously (the meaning ascribed to it by CPD). It would hardly seem sensible for the Buddha to sit out in the open if rain was falling heavily.Spk: He was sitting there reviewing his practice of striving in order to provide a model for clansmen in the future, who would strive in emulation of the Teacher.",
    "sn4.2:2": "v.449\"You’ve wandered through the long courseCreating beautiful and hideous shapes.Enough, Evil One, with that trick of yours:You’re defeated, End-maker!\"[n.67] in pāda a we should read with Be, Se, and Eesaṁsaraṁrather than Ee1saṁsaraṁ.The \"long course\"(digham addhanaṁ)is saṁsara.Spk: It is said that there is no form that Māra had not previously assumed in order to frighten the Blessed One.",
    "sn4.2:3": "Then Māra the Evil One, realizing, \"The Blessed One knows me, the Fortunate One knows me,\" sad and disappointed, disappeared right there."
