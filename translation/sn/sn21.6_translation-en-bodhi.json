    "sn21.6:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya approached the Blessed One.[n.390] His name means \"Bhaddiya the Dwarf.\" The prose portion is atUd 76; see tooUd 74,20–75,6.Spknotes that it was the monks of the \"gang of six\" (chabbhagiyā bhikkhū,the mischief-makers of the Saṅgha often mentioned in the Vinaya Piṭaka) who had been ridiculing him. Bhaddiya's ugliness, according to Spk, was the kammic result of his behaviour in a previous life when he was a king who mocked and harassed old people. Though ugly in appearance, he had a lovely voice, which resulted from another past life when he was a cuckoo who offered a sweet mango to the Buddha Vipassi. The Buddha declared him the foremost of bhikkhus having a sweet voice (mañjussara;AN I 23,24). His verses atTh 466–72do not include the verses here.The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, do you see that bhikkhu coming, ugly, unsightly, deformed, despised among the bhikkhus?\"",
    "sn21.6:2": "\"Geese, herons, and peacocks,Elephants, and spotted deer,All are frightened of the lionRegardless of their bodies’ size.",
    "sn21.6:3": "\"In the same way among human beingsThe small one endowed with wisdom—He is the one that is truly great,Not the fool with a well-built body.\"sn.ii.280"
