    "sn24.5:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view as this arise:[n.254] This is the full nihilist doctrine(natthikavāda). AtDN I 55,5–3,it is called annihilationism(ucchedavāda)and ascribed to Ajita Kesakambalī. For the commentarial explanation, see Bodhi,The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship,pp. 77–83.‘There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing presented in charity; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously; no ascetics and brahmins faring and practising rightly in the world who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others. This person consists of the four great elements.sn.iii.207When one dies, earth returns to and merges with the earth-body; water returns to and merges with the water-body; fire returns to and merges with the fire-body; air returns to and merges with the air-body; the faculties are transferred to space.Fourmen with the bier as fifth carry away the corpse. The funeral orations last as far as the charnel ground; the bones whiten; burnt offerings end with ashes. Giving is a doctrine of fools. When anyone asserts the doctrine that there isgiving and the like, it is empty, false prattle. Fools and the wise are alike cut off and perish with the breakup of the body; after death they do not exist’?\"",
