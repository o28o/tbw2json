    "sn22.45:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, form is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering.sn.iii.45What is suffering is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.[n.58]Spk: Seeing with correct wisdom(sammappaññāya)is the wisdom of the path together with insight. The mind becomes dispassionate(virajjati)at the moment of the path, and is liberated(vimuccati)at the moment of the fruit."
