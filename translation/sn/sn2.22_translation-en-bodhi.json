    "sn2.22:1": "Standing to one side, the young deva Khema recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn2.22:2": "v.37\"Foolish people devoid of wisdomBehave like enemies towards themselves.They go about doing evil deedsWhich yield only bitter fruit.",
    "sn2.22:3": "v.28\"That deed is not well performedWhich, having been done, is then repented,The result of which one experiencesWeeping with a tearful face.",
    "sn2.22:4": "v.329\"But that deed is well performedWhich, having been done, is not repented,The result of which one experiencesJoyfully with a happy mind.\"[n.173] I follow Se, which adds a terminal ti after the third verse and ascribes the next three verses to the Buddha. No change of speaker is indicated in Be or Ee1.",
    "sn2.22:5": "v.330\"One should promptly do the deedOne knows leads to one's own welfare;The thinker, the wise one, should not advanceWith the reflection of the carter.",
    "sn2.22:6": "v.331\"As the carter who left the highway,A road with an even surface,And entered upon a rugged bypathBroods mournfully with a broken axle—",
    "sn2.22:7": "v.332\"So the fool, having left the DhammaTo follow a way opposed to Dhamma,When he falls into the mouth of DeathBroods like the carter with a broken axle.\"[n.14] ¶¶5–6 are quoted at Mil 66–6. In ¶5c I read with Be, Se, and Ee2sakaṭikacintaya; mantain pāda d must be the nominative of the agent nounmantar.In ¶6a I follow Se and Ee1 & 2, which readpanthaṁ,as against Bemaṭṭhaṁ;Mil (Ee and Se) readsnama(a corruption?).Spkglosses pāda d:akkhachinno va jhayati ti akkhachinno avajhayati,which suggests thatvais not the emphatic indeclinable but a verbal prefix. Spk, however, takes thevain ¶ to representviya.Onmaccumukha(in ¶c) as \"the mouth of Death\" rather than \"the face of Death,\" see Ja IV 21,, Ja V 49,29, and Vism 233,21–22 (Ppn 8:20)."
