I would prefer to amend the final verb in Be and Se (and SS) fromanupāpuṇātutoanupāpuṇātiso that we read:Kaṁ bhikkhave asanivicakkaṁ āgacchatu?

For a lightning bolt, striking one on the head, destroys only a single individual existence, but one with a mind obsessed by gain, honour, and praise experiences endless suffering in hell, etc.\" While he has not yet reached his mind's ideal(appattamānasa): while he has not achieved arahantship.",
