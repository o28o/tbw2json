    "sn1.48:1": "v.56\"This indeed is that Jeta's Grove,The resort of the Order of seers,Dwelt in by the Dhamma King,A place that gives me joy.[n.04] These verses were spoken by Anāthapiṇḍika, chief patron of the Buddha, after he was reborn in the Tusita heaven. They recur below, with prose text, atSN2.20.sn.i.34",
    "sn1.48:2": "v.157\"Action, knowledge, righteousness,Virtue, an excellent life:By this are mortals purified,Not by clan or wealth.",
    "sn1.48:3": "v.158\"Therefore a person who is wise,Out of regard for his own good,Should carefully examine the Dhamma:Thus he is purified in it.",
    "sn1.48:4": "v.159\"Sāriputta truly is endowed with wisdom,With virtue and with inner peace.Even a bhikkhu who has gone beyondAt best can only equal him.\"[n.105] Anāthapiṇḍika had been especially devoted to Sāriputta, who delivered a moving sermon to him while he was on his deathbed: seeMN No. 13, which also includes the same account of the great patron's posthumous visit to Jeta's Grove.\n\t\t\n\t.Spk: At best can only equal him(etavaparamo siya): There is no bhikkhu, not even one who has attained Nibbāna, who surpasses the Elder Sāriputta(na therena uttaritaro nama atthi)."
