Bothsamattaandsamadinnaare alternative past participle formations ofsam + a + da.PED does not mention this derivation, but only that from Sktsamapta(and from Sktsamasta,not relevant here). For the derivation fromsamatta,see Nidd I 289,6–8; for the derivation fromsamapta,see Nidd I 65,9–.What were the seven vows?",
