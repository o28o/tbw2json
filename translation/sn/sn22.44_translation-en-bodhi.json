    "sn22.44:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.iii.44\"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way leading to the origination of identity and the way leading to the cessation of identity. Listen to that …",
    "sn22.44:2": "\"And what, bhikkhus, is the way leading to the cessation of identity? Here, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple … does not regard form as self … nor feeling as self … nor perception as self … nor volitional formations as self … nor consciousness as self … nor self as in consciousness. This, bhikkhus, is called the way leading to the cessation of identity. When it is said, ‘The way leading to the cessation of identity,’ the meaning here is this: a way of regarding things that leads to the cessation of suffering.\""
