    "sn35.131:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas at Suṁsumaragira in the Bhesakaḷa Grove, the Deer Park. Then the householder Nakulapita approached the Blessed One … and said to him….[n.28] SeeSN22.. The name means \"Nakula's father.\" His wife is called Nakulamata, \"Nakula's mother,\" though the texts never disclose the identity of Nakula. The Buddha pronounced him and his wife the most trusting(etadaggaṁ vissasakanaṁ)of his lay disciplesAN.257(AN I 26). According toSpk, they had been the Blessed One's parents in five hundred past lives and his close relations in many more past lives. For additional references see DPPN 2:3 and Hecker, \"Shorter Lives of the Disciples,\" in Nyanaponika and Hecker,Great Disciples of the Buddha,pp. 375–78."
