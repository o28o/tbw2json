    "sn1.58:2": "v.198\"Lust is declared the deviant path;Life undergoes destruction night and day;Women are the stain of the holy life:Here menfolk are enmeshed.Austerity and the holy life—That is the bath without water.\"[n.119]Spk: The deviant path(uppatha)is a nonpath(amagga)for going to heaven and Nibbāna. Undergoes destruction day and night(rattindivakkhaya): it is destroyed by the days and nights or during the days and nights. Women are the stain of the holy life: by washing off an external stain one can become clean, but if one is defiled by the stain of women it is not possible to make oneself pure. Austerity(tapa)is a name for restraint, the ascetic practices(dhutaṅgaguṇa), energy, and extreme asceticism(dukkarakarika); all these except extreme asceticism (i.e., self-mortification) are practices that burn up the defilements. The holy life(brahmacariya)is abstinence from sexual intercourse.On \"the bath without water\" see vv.646,705. To appreciate this expression one must remember that for the brahmins in the Buddha’s time (as for many Hindus today) ritual bathing was a way to wash away one's sins. The Buddha replaced this with the \"internal bath\" of the mind; seeSN7.1below andMN I 39,1–,80,18–0."
