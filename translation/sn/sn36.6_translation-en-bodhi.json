    "sn36.6:1": "\"Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling feels a pleasant feeling, a painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The instructed noble disciple too feels a pleasant feeling,sn.iv.208a painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Therein, bhikkhus, what is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling?\"",
    "sn36.6:2": "\"Bhikkhus, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught.[n.36]Spksays that among the noble disciples, here the stress is on the arahant, though the nonreturner would also be appropriate.

Everyone with a body, including the Buddhas, is subject to bodily painful feeling (here,kayikā dukkhā vedanā).He feels one feeling—a bodily one, not a mental one.",
