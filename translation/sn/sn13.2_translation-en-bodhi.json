    "sn13.2:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, suppose there was a pond fifty yojanas long, fifty yojanas wide, and fifty yojanas deep, full of water, overflowing so that a crow could drink from it, and a man would draw out some water from it on the tip of a blade of kusa grass. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the water drawn out on the tip of the blade of kusa grass or the water in the pond?\"[n.220] Theyojanais a measure of distance roughly equal to ten kilometers.Spkexplainskākapeyya(lit. \"crow-drinkable\") thus: \"So that it is possible for a crow, standing on the bank, to drink from it naturally by inserting its beak.\"",
    "sn13.2:2": "\"Venerable sir, the water in the pond is more. The water drawn out on the tip of the blade of kusa grass is trifling. It does not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the water in the pond.\"",
    "sn13.2:3": "\"So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough, the suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated is more, while that which remains is trifling … . Of such great benefit, bhikkhus, is the breakthrough to the Dhamma, of such great benefit is it to obtain the vision of the Dhamma.\""
