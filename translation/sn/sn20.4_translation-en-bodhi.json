    "sn20.4:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, if someone were to give away a hundred pots of food[n.362] Be and Se:okkhāsataṁ;Ee:ukkhāsataṁ.Spk: =mahāmukhaukkhalīnaṁ sataṁ.Spk-pṭ: = khānaṁ mahantakoḷumbānaṁ sataṁ. The reference is to large pots used to boil a great quantity of rice.AN IV 394–96makes the same point somewhat differently, and adds that developing the perception of impermanence even for a fingersnap is still more fruitful than developing a mind of lovingkindness.as charity in the morning, a hundred pots of food as charity at noon, and a hundred pots of food as charity in the evening, and if someone else were to develop a mind of lovingkindness even for the time it takes to pull a cow's udder, either in the morning, at noon, or in the evening, this would be more fruitful than the former.[n.363] Spk:Gadduhanamattan ti goduhanamattaṁ(lit. \"the extent of a cow's milking\"), that is, the extent of time needed to take one pull on a cow's teat. Or else (gadduhanamattaṁ = gandhaūhanamattaṁ— lit. \"the extent of a scent-sniff\"), that is, the extent of time needed to take a single sniff of a piece of incense picked up with two fingers. If, for even such a short time, one is able to develop a mind of lovingkindness, pervading all beings in immeasurable world systems with a wish for their welfare, this is more fruitful even than that alms given three times in a single day."
