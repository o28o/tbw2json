    "sn15.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "sn15.1:2": "\"Bhikkhus, this saṁsara is without discoverable beginning.[n.54]Anamataggo ’yaṁ bhikkhave saṁsāro.Spkresolves ā into anu amatagga, explaining: \"Even if it should be pursued by knowledge for a hundred or a thousand years, it would be with unthought-of beginning, with unknown beginning(vassasataṁ vassasahassaṁ ñāṇena anugantva pi amataggo aviditaggo). It wouldn’t be possible to know its beginning from here or from there; the meaning is that it is without a delimiting first or last point. Saṁsara is the uninterruptedly occurring succession of the aggregates, etc.(khandhādīnaṁ avicchinnappavattā paṭipāṭi).\"The BHS equivalent ofanamataggaisanavarāgra(e.g., at Mvu I 34,7), \"without lower or upper limit.\" For various explanations, see CPD, s.v.an-amat’-agga.A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose, bhikkhus, a man would cut up whatever grass, sticks, branches, and foliage there are in this Jambudīpa and collect them together into a single heap. Having done so, he would put them down, sayingfor each one: ‘This is my mother, this my mother's mother.’ The sequence of that man's mothers and grandmothers would not come to an end, yet the grass, wood, branches, and foliage in this Jambudīpa would be used up and exhausted. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, this saṁsara is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced suffering, anguish, and disaster, and swelled the cemetery. It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations, enough to become dispassionate towards them, enough to be liberated from them.\"sn.ii.179"
