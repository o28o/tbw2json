    "sn22.61:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, form is burning, feeling is burning, perception is burning, volitional formations are burning, consciousness is burning.[n.94] This is a compressed version of the fuller Aditta Sutta atSN35.28, which applies the metaphor of burning to the twelve sense bases. Perhaps the present sutta was composed by simply replacing the sense bases with the aggregates, and was then compressed so that it would not \"steal the show\" from the more famous sutta, popularly known as the Fire Sermon, regarded by the Pali tradition as the third formal discourse of the Buddha’s ministry.Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassionhis mindis liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It's liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’\""
