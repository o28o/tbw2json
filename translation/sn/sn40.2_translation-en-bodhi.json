    "sn40.2:1": "… \"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the second jhāna, the second jhāna.\" What now is the second jhāna?’[n.279] Cp.SN2., where the same experience is discussed in terms of \"noble silence\"(ariya tuṇhibhāva), a technical code term for the second jhāna.",
    "sn40.2:2": "\"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallana, Moggallana, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the second jhāna. Steady your mind in the second jhāna, unify your mind in the second jhāna, concentrate your mind in the second jhāna.’ Then, on a later occasion, with the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelt in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration."
