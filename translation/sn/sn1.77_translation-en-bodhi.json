    "sn1.77:3": "v.241\"Mastery is sovereignty in the world;A woman ranks as the best of goods;[n.16]Spk: A woman is called the best of goods because a woman is an article that should not be given away(avissajjaniyabaṇḍatta;)or else she is so called because all bodhisattas and wheel-turning monarchs are conceived in a mother's womb. Spk-pṭ: Even the most precious jewel is not called \"the best of goods\" because it still falls into the category of things that might be given away; but a woman who has not abandoned the family customs should not be relinquished to anyone, and hence she is called the best of goods. Further, a woman is the best of goods because she is a mine for the best of gems, that is, because (her body) is the place for the birth of the human thoroughbreds (i.e., Buddhas and arahants).In the world anger is a rusty sword;Thieves in the world are considered a plague.[n.17]Abbuda(\"plague\") is glossed bySpkasvinasakaraṇa,a cause of destruction. The word also occurs in v.591as an extremely high number, inSN6.10as the name of a hell, and at v.80as a stage in the development of the fetus.",
