    "sn2.2:1": "At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, the young deva Kassapa recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn2.2:2": "v.56\"A bhikkhu should be a meditator,One who is liberated in mind,If he desires the heart's attainment,Bent on that as his advantage.Having known the world's rise and fall,Let him be lofty in mind and unattached.\"[n.145] in pāda b, I read ce with Be, Se, and Ee, as against ca in Ee1. I construe the convoluted syntax of this verse in accordance withSpk. Spk explains that he should be liberated in mind(vimuttacitto)through (temporary) liberation by devotion to the meditation subject (Spk-pṭ: liberation by insight and jhāna, which are temporary types of liberation, since at this point he has not yet attained arahantship, the final liberation of mind). The heart's attainment(hadayassanupatti)is arahantship, which is also the advantage(ānisaṁsā)on which he should be bent.sn.i.47"
