    "sn6.11:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on the bank of the river Sappini. Then, when the night had advanced, Brahma Sanankumara, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire bank of the river Sappini, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side.[n.40]Spk: When he was the youth Pañcasikha he developed jhāna and was reborn in the brahma world. Because he retained the appearance of a youth they knew him as Kumara, but because of his great age he was called Sanankumara, \"Forever Youthful.\" He makes a dramatic appearance atDN II 20–9. AtMN I 358,28–29Ānanda utters the verse after he has given a detailed analysis of the two terms knowledge(vijjā)and conduct(caraṇa).Standing to one side, he recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn6.11:2": "v.596\"The khattiya is the best among peopleFor those whose standard is the clan,But one accomplished in knowledge and conductIs best among devas and humans.\"",
    "sn6.11:3": "This is what Brahma Sanankumara said. The Teacher approved. Then Brahma Sanankumara, thinking, \"The Teacher has approved of me,\" paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on his right, he disappeared right there."
