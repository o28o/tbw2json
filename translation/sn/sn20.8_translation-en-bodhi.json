    "sn20.8:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ves훮l카 in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "sn20.8:2": "\"Bhikkhus, now the Licchavis dwell using blocks of wood as cushions;sn.ii.68they are diligent and ardent in exercise. King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the Videhan son, does not gain access to them; he does not get a hold on them. But in the future the Licchavis will become delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet; they will sleep until sunrise on soft beds with pillows of cotton wool. Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha will gain access to them; then he will get a hold on them.",
    "sn20.8:3": "\"Bhikkhus, now the bhikkhus dwell using blocks of wood as cushions; they are diligent and ardent in striving. M훮ra the Evil One does not gain access to them; he does not get a hold on them. But in the future the bhikkhus will become delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet; they will sleep until sunrise on soft beds with pillows of cotton wool. Then M훮ra the Evil One will gain access to them; he will get a hold on them."
