    "sn1.6:1": "At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devata recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn1.6:2": "v.9\"How many are asleep whenothersare awake?How many are awake whenotherssleep?By how many does one gather dust?By how many is one purified?\"",
    "sn1.6:3": "v.10\"Five are asleep whenothersare awake;Five are awake whenotherssleep.By five things one gathers dust,By five things one is purified.\"[n.1]Spksays, \"When the five faculties are awake the five hindrances are asleep, and when the five hindrances are asleep the five faculties are awake,\" but this seems redundant; the explanation would be more satisfactory if we take the first phrase to be stating that when the five faculties are asleep the five hindrances are awake, thus making more explicit the relationship of diametric opposition and mutual exclusion between the two pentads. Spk continues: \"It is by the same five hindrances thatone gathers dust,i.e., the dust of the defilements; and it is by the five faculties thatone is purified.\"sn.i.4"
