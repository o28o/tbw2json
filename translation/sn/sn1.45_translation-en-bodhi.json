    "sn1.45:1": "v.48\"Behold him of perfect name,The seer of the subtle goal,The giver of wisdom, unattachedTo the lair of sensual pleasures.Behold the wise one, all-knowing,The great seer treading the noble path.\"[n.99]Spk: Of perfect name(anomanama): of undefective name, of complete name, because he (the Buddha) possesses all excellent qualities (see too v.927cand n.653). The seer of the subtle goal (or \"meanings\":nipuṇatthadassiṁ): because he sees the fine, recondite meanings such as the diversity of aggregates, etc. He is the giver of wisdom(paññadadaṁ)by teaching the path of practice for the achievement of wisdom. Treading the noble path(ariye pathe kamamanaṁ): the present tense is used with reference to the past, for the Blessed One had gone along the noble path on the site of the great enlightenment; he is not going along it now. I question Spk's explanation of nipuṇattha, which seems to refer to attha in the sense of the goal, i.e., Nibbāna."
