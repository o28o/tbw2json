    "sn1.24:1": "v.59\"From whatever one reins in the mind,From that no suffering comes to one.Should one rein in the mind from everything,One is freed from all suffering.\"",
    "sn1.24:2": "v.60\"One need not rein in the mind from everythingWhen the mind has come under control.From whatever it is that evil comes,From this one should rein in the mind.\"[n.47] Readings of pāda b differ. I follow Se and Ee, mano yatattam agataṁ, as against Be na mano saṁyatattam agataṁ.Spk: This deva held the view that one should rein in every state of mind; whether wholesome or not, whether mundane or supramundane, the mind should be reined in, not aroused. (Spk-pṭ: He believed that every state of mind brings suffering and that the unconscious state is better.) The Buddha spoke the rejoinder to show that a distinction should be made between the mind to be reined in and the mind to be developed. SeeSN35:05(IV 195,15–30), where the Buddha advises reining in the mind(tato cittaṁ nivaraye)from objects that arouse the defilements."
