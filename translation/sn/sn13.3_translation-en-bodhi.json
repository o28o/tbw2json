    "sn13.3:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.ii.35\"Bhikkhus, suppose that in the place where these great rivers meet and converge—that is, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Aciravati, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—a man would draw out two or three drops of water. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: these two or three drops of water that have been drawn out or the water at the confluence?\"",
    "sn13.3:2": "\"Venerable sir, the water at the confluence is more. The two or three drops of water that have been drawn out are trifling. They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the water at the confluence.\""
