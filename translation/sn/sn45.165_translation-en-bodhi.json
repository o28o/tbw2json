    "sn45.165:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of suffering. What three? Suffering due to pain, suffering due to formations, suffering due to change.[n.45] Briefly, suffering due to pain(dukkhadukkhata)is painful bodily and mental feeling; suffering due to the formations(saṅkhāradukkhata)is all conditioned phenomena of the three planes, because they are oppressed by rise and fall; and suffering due to change(viparinamadukkhta)is pleasant feeling, which brings suffering when it comes to an end..These are the three kinds of suffering. The Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these three kinds of suffering, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.\"sn.v.57"
