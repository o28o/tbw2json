    "sn22.46:2": "\"When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one holds no more views concerning the past. When one holds no more views concerning the past,sn.iii.46one holds no more views concerning the future. When one holds no more views concerning the future, one has no more obstinate grasping.[n.60] The two expressions, \"views concerning the past\"(pubbāntānudiṭṭhiyo)and \"views concerning the future\"(aparāntānudiṭṭhiyo), clearly allude to the Brahmajala Sutta (DN No. 1), which describes the famous sixty-two speculative views, eighteen about the past and forty-four about the future.Spkconfirms this, and explains that at this point the first path has been shown (Spk-pṭ: by showing the complete abandonment of views). The following passage shows the three higher paths and fruits; or, alternatively, the former passage shows the abandoning of views by way of mere insight, the sequel the four paths along with insight.For \"obstinate grasping,\" Sethāmasā parāmāsoseems superior to Bethāmaso parāmāsoand Eethāmaso parāmaso;that is the reading atMN I 130,34,57,4, etc. Spk glosses \"obstinate grasping\" as the obstinacy of views(diṭṭhithāmaso)and the grasping of views(diṭṭhiparāmāso), apparently construingthāmasā,an instrumental used adverbially, as if it were an independent noun.When one has no more obstinate grasping, the mind becomes dispassionate towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging."
