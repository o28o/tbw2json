    "sn35.135:1": "\"Bhikkhus, it is a gain for you, it is well gained by you, that you have obtained the opportunity for living the holy life. I have seen, bhikkhus, the hell named ‘Contact's Sixfold Base.’[n.38]Chaphassāyatanikā.Spk: There is no separate hell named \"Contact's Sixfold Base,\" for this designation applies to all thirty-one great hells; but this is said here with reference to the great hell Avīci. AtSN56.43, a hell so described is referred to asmahāpariḷāha niraya,the Hell of the Great Conflagration.There whatever form one sees with the eye is undesirable, never desirable; unlovely, never lovely; disagreeable, never agreeable. Whatever sound one hears with the ear … Whatever odour one smells with the nose … Whatever taste one savours with the tongue … Whatever tactile object one feels with the body … Whatever mental phenomenon one cognizes with the mind is undesirable, never desirable; unlovely, never lovely; disagreeable, never agreeable."
