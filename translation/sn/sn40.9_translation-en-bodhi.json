    "sn40.9:1": "… \"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the signless concentration of mind, the signless concentration of mind.\" What now is the signless concentration of mind?’[n.280]Animitta cetosamādhi.Spk: This refers to insight concentration(vipassanāsamādhi), which occurs when one has abandoned the sign of permanence, etc.The \"signless concentration of mind\" is not defined further in the Nikāyas, but its placement after the eighth formless attainment suggests it is a samādhi qualitatively different from those attained in samatha meditation. Below, it occurs in the explanation of the \"signless liberation of mind\" (animittā cetovimutti,atSN4.7; IV 297,3–6). AtSN43.4, the signless concentration(animitta samādhi)is called the path leading to the unconditioned. For a wide-ranging overview of the signless meditation, see Harvey, \"Signless Meditation in Pali Buddhism.\" See too below nn.32,368.",
    "sn40.9:2": "\"Then, friends, by nonattention to all signs, I entered and dwelt in the signless concentration of mind. While I dwelt therein my consciousness followed along with signs.[n.81]Nimittānusāri viññāṇaṃ hoti.Spk: This occurred while his insight knowledge was flowing along sharply and strongly as he dwelt in insight concentration. Just as, when a man is cutting down a tree with a sharp axe, if he constantly inspects the blade he doesn’t accomplish the function of cutting down the tree, so the elder developed a liking(nikanti)for insight and thus did not accomplish its function."
