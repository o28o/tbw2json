    "sn22.159:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One … and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.\"[n.238]Spk: Ānanda had seen other bhikkhus receive from the Buddha a meditation subject based on the five aggregates, attain arahantship, and declare final knowledge in the Teacher's presence. He thus approached thinking to do the same. The Buddha knew he would not attain the three higher paths during his own lifetime, but he gave him instructions to satisfy him. Ānanda would attend to his meditation subject for one or two turns before going to serve the Teacher, and it became one of the factors that matured in his liberation.",
    "sn22.159:2": "\"What do you think, Ānanda, is form permanent or impermanent?\" - \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" - \"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\" - \"Suffering, venerable sir.\" - \"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?\" - \"No, venerable sir.\""
