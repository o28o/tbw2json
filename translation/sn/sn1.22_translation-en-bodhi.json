    "sn1.22:1": "v.53\"It does not touch one who does not touch,But then will touch the one who touches.Therefore it touches the one who touches,The one who wrongs an innocent man.\"[n.4] The verse poses a riddle which hinges on two connotations ofphusati,\"to touch\": (i) to acquire a particular kamma, here the grave kamma of wronging an innocent person; and (ii) to reap the result of that kamma when it comes to maturity.",
    "sn1.22:2": "v.54\"If one wrongs an innocent man,A pure person without blemish,The evil falls back on the fool himselfLike fine dust thrown against the wind.\"[n.4] AtSn66this verse refers to Kokaliya's calumny of Sāriputta and Moggallana (SN6.10, which includes the story but not this verse). A different, and less credible, background story is told at Dhp-a III 31–33, commenting onDhp15; see BL :8–84. On the kammic result of harming innocents, seeDhp137–140."
