    "sn1.60:2": "v.0\"Metre is the scaffolding of verses;Syllables constitute their phrasing;Verses rest on a base of names;The poet is the abode of verses.\"[n.10]Spk: Metre is the scaffolding of verses(chando nidanaṁ gathanaṁ): Metres, beginning with thegayatti,are the scaffolding of verses; for one beginning the preliminary verses first considers, \"In which metre should it be?\" Syllables constitute their phrasing(akkhara tasaṁ viyañjanaṁ): For syllables make up words, and words make up a verse, and a verse reveals the meaning. Verses rest on a base of names: One composing a verse composes it by relying on some name such as \"the ocean\" or \"the earth.\" The poet is the abode where verses dwell: The abode(asaya)of verses is their support(patiṭṭha); verses come forth from the poet, and thus he is their support."
