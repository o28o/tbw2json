    "sn35.151:1": "\"Bhikkhus, this holy life is lived without students and without a teacher.[n.48]Anantevāsikam idaṃ bhikkhave brahmacariyaṃ vussati anācariyakaṃ.This is a riddle which turns upon two puns difficult to replicate in English. A \"student\"(antevāsā)is literally \"one who dwells within,\" and thus (as the text explains below) one for whom defilements do not dwell within(na antovasanti)is said to be \"without students.\" The word \"teacher\"(acariya)is here playfully connected with the verb \"to assail\"(samudācarati); thus one unassailed by defilements is said to be \"without a teacher.\"Spkglossesanantevāsikaṁwithanto vasanakilesavirahitaṇm(\"devoid of defilements dwelling within\"), and anacāriyakaṁ with acaraṇakilesavirahitaṇm (\"devoid of the ‘assailing’ defilements\").A bhikkhu who has students and a teacher dwells in suffering, not in comfort. A bhikkhu who has no students and no teacher dwells happily, in comfort.",
    "sn35.151:2–3": "\"Further, when a bhikkhu has heard a sound with the ear … cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind …sn.iv.137he is called ‘one who has a teacher.’",
    "sn35.151:4": "\"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu who has no students and no teacher dwell happily, in comfort? Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has seen a form with the eye, there do not arise in him evil unwholesome states, memories and intentions connected with the fetters. They do not dwell within him. Since those evil unwholesome states do not dwell within him, he is called ‘one who has no students.’ They do not assail him. Since evil unwholesome states do not assail him, he is called ‘one who has no teacher.’",
