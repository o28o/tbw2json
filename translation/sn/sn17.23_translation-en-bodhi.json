    "sn17.23:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . A faithful female lay follower, rightly imploring her only son, dear and beloved, might implore him thus: ‘Dear, you should become like Citta the householder and Hatthaka of Āḷavaka’—for this is the standard and criterion for my male disciples who are lay followers, that is, Citta the householder and Hatthaka of Āḷavaka.Cp.AN I 88,3–89,3.This sutta and the next seem to be quoting fromAN II 64, 4–22, where the Buddha names the \"standards and criteria\" for the four classes of his followers. Citta the householder was the foremost male lay disciple among the speakers on the Dhamma; see the Cittasaṁyutta (SN4:–0). Hatthaka Āḷavaka was the foremost of those who propitiate an assembly with the four means of beneficence; seeAN:25andAN IV 27–20, and I, n.604.‘But if, dear, you go forth from the household life into homelessness, you should become like Sāriputta and Moggallana’—for this is the standard and criterion for my male disciples who are bhikkhus, that is, Sāriputta and Moggallana. ‘While, dear, you are a trainee, one who has not yet reached his mind's ideal, may gain, honour, and praise not come upon you!’"
