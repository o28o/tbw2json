One \"fully understands what can be expressed\" by way of the three kinds of full understanding: (i) by full understanding of the known(ñātapariññā)one understands the five aggregates in terms of their individual characteristics, etc.; (ii) by full understanding by scrutinization(tiraṇapariññā)one scrutinizes them in forty-two modes as impermanent, suffering, etc.; (iii) by full understanding as abandonment(pahānapariññā)one abandons desire and lust for the aggregates by means of the supreme path. For a fuller discussion, see Vism 606–7 (Ppn 20:3–4) and Vism 6–3 (Ppn 20:8–9), based on Paṭis II 238–42, where, however, only forty modes are enumerated under (ii). The forty-two modes are at Vism 655,5–30 (Ppn 2:59), in connection with \"discerning formations as void.\"",
