    "sn13.4:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, suppose that in the place where these great rivers meet and converge—that is, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Aciravati, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—their water would be destroyed and eliminated except for two or three drops. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the water at the confluence that has been destroyed and eliminated or the two or three drops of water that remain?\"",

They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of the water that has been destroyed and eliminated.\""
