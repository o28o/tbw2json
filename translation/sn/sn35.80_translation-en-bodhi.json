    "sn35.80:5": "\"But, venerable sir, how should a bhikkhu know, how should he see, for ignorance to be abandoned by him and true knowledge to arise?\"",
    "sn35.80:6": "\"Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu has heard, ‘Nothing is worth adhering to.’ When a bhikkhu has heard, ‘Nothing is worth adhering to,’ he directly knows everything. Having directly known everything, he fully understands everything. Having fully understood everything, he sees all signs differently.[n.43] The first part of this instruction, as far as \"he fully understands everything,\" is included in the \"brief advice on liberation through the extinction of craving\" atMN37(MN I 251,21–25) andAN7.1(AN IV 88,11–15); the sequel is different.Spk: \"He sees all signs differently\"(sabbanimittīni aññato passati): He sees all the signs of formations(saṅkhāranimitāni)in a way different from that of people who have not fully understood the adherences. For such people see all signs as self, but one who has fully understood the adherences sees them as nonself, not as self. Thus in this sutta the characteristic of nonself is discussed.He sees the eye differently, he sees forms differently … whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too he sees differently."
