    "sn22.157:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, do the fetters, adherences, and shackles arise?\"[n.237]Spk-pṭ explains adherences(abhinivesa)as craving, conceit, and views, and shackles(vinibandha)as the mental shackles of not being devoid of lust for form, etc. (seeMN I 0,28–02,6). Holding(ajjhosāna), in the next sutta, is defined by Spk-pṭ as craving and views."
