    "sn47.2:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in Ambapali's Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"",
    "sn47.2:2": "\"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful and clearly comprehending: this is our instruction to you.[n.15] The same advice is atSN36.7(IV 11,1–19).Spkcomments at length on the practice of clear comprehension. For a translation see Soma,The Way of Mindfulness,pp. 83–13, and Bodhi,Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship,pp. 96–134. Briefly, the four are: (1) clear comprehension of purpose-fulness(sātthaka-sampajañña), discerning a worthy purpose in one's intended action; () clear comprehension of suitability(sappāya-sampajañña), discerning a suitable means of achieving one's aim; (3) clear comprehension of the resort(gocara-sampajañña), maintaining awareness of one's meditation subject when engaged in various activities; and (4) clear comprehension as nondelusion(asammoha-sampajañña), discerning one's actions as conditioned processes devoid of a substantial self. For a good contemporary explanation, see Nyanaponika,The Heart of Buddhist Meditation,pp. 46–57.",
    "sn47.2:3": "\"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu exercise clear comprehension? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning; when looking ahead and looking aside; when drawing in and extending the limbs; when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; when eating, drinking, chewing his food, and tasting; when defecating and urinating; when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent. It is in such a way that a bhikkhu exercises clear comprehension."
