    "sn11.9:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, once in the past a number of seers who were virtuous and of good character had settled down in leaf huts in a tract of forest. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, and Vepacitti, lord of the asuras, approached those seers.",
    "sn11.9:2": "v.898\"‘The odour of the seers long bound by their vows,Emitted from their bodies, goes with the wind.Turn away from here, O thousand-eyed god,For the seers’ odour is foul, O deva-king.’[n.69]Spkglossesciradikkhitanaṁin pāda a ascirasamadiṇṇavatanaṁ,\"who have long undertaken vows.\" On \"thousand-eyed\"(sahassanetta)as an epithet of Sakka, seeSN11.1; though there the Pali issahassakkha,the meaning is the same. The seers say this because they subscribe to the common belief that the devas find the smell of human bodies repulsive—particularly ascetics who may not bathe frequently (see Mātali's argument at v.93). Sakka's reply conveys the same point asDhp 54–56: the scent of virtue is supreme among all scents and pervades even the worlds of the devas.",
    "sn11.9:3": "v.899\"‘Let the odour of the seers long bound by their vows,Emitted from their bodies, go with the wind;We yearn for this odour, O venerable sirs,As for a garland of flowers on the head.sn.i.227The devas do not perceive it as repulsive.’\"[n.60]Spkparaphrases: \"The devas do not perceive anything repulsive in this odour of the virtuous ones; they perceive it as desirable, lovely, agreeable.\""
