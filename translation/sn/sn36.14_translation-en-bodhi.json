    "sn36.14:1": "\"Bhikkhus, suppose there is a guest house. People come from the east, west, north, and south and lodge there; khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas come and lodge there. So too, bhikkhus, various feelings arise in this body: pleasant feeling arises, painful feeling arises, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises; carnal pleasant feeling arises; carnal painful feeling arises; carnal neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises; spiritual pleasant feeling arises; spiritual painful feeling arises; spiritual neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.\"[n.244]Spk: Carnal(sāmisā)pleasant feeling is the feeling connected with carnal sensuality; spiritual(nirāmisā̄)pleasant feeling is the feeling arisen in the first jhāna, etc., or by way of insight, or by way of recollection (of the Buddha, etc.). Carnal painful feeling is the carnal feeling arisen through carnal sensuality (Spk-pṭ: the painful feeling of those who undergo suffering because of sensuality); spiritual painful feeling, the feeling of displeasure(domanassa)arisen through yearning for the unsurpassed deliverances (Spkpṭ: namely, the fruit of arahantship). Carnal neutral feeling is the carnal feeling arisen through carnal sensuality; spiritual neutral feeling, the neutral feeling arisen by way of the fourth jhāna. See tooSN36.3."
