    "sn35.90:1": "\"Bhikkhus, being stirred is a disease, being stirred is a tumour, being stirred is a dart.[n.62]Spk: Stirring(ejā)is craving, so called in the sense of moving(calanaṇāhena).Anejā,\"unstirred,\" is a common description of an arahant.Therefore, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata dwells unstirred, with the dart removed.sn.iv.65Therefore, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu should wish, ‘May I dwell unstirred, with the dart removed!’ he should not conceive the eye, should not conceive in the eye, should not conceive from the eye, should not conceive, ‘The eye is mine.’[n.63] As atSN35.30; see n.6.",
    "sn35.90:2–3": "\"He should not conceive the ear … He should not conceive the mind … mental phenomena … mind-consciousness … mind-contact … and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, ‘That is mine.’",
    "sn35.90:4": "\"Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.sn.iv.66He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’\""
