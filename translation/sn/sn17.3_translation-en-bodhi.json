    "sn17.3:2": "\"‘Hunter,’ bhikkhus: this is a designation for Māra the Evil One. ‘Corded harpoon’: this is a designation for gain, honour, and praise. ‘Cord’: this is a designation for delight and lust. Any bhikkhu who relishes and enjoys the arisen gain, honour, and praise is called a bhikkhu who has been struck with a corded harpoon,[n.319] Although all three eds. readgiddho papataya,it seems we should readviddho papatāya,proposed by a note inBe.who has met with calamity and disaster, and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … .sn.ii.8Thus should you train yourselves.\""
