    "sn1.21:1": "At Sāvatthī. Standing to one side, that devata recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn1.21:2": "v.51\"As if smitten by a sword,As if his head were on fire,A bhikkhu should wander mindfullyTo abandon sensual lust.\"",
    "sn1.21:3": "v.52\"As if smitten by a sword,As if his head were on fire,A bhikkhu should wander mindfullyTo abandon identity view.\"[n.40] in pāda b, I readḍayhamane va,with Ee1 and SS, as againstḍayhamano vain Be, Se, and Ee2. Withbhavaragain pāda c, these verses also appear asTh 9–40and1162–6. In the present form the pair of verses sets a problem in interpretation, for kamaraga, sensual lust, is abandoned by the third path, whilesakkāyadiṭṭhi,identity view, is abandoned by the first path, so the devata appears to be advocating a higher attainment than the Buddha. This problem does not arise in the Th version, sincebhavaraga,lust for existence, is abandoned by the fourth path, that of arahantship.Spkgives an ingenious solution: The deva spoke his verse with reference to the abandoning of sensual lust by way of suppression only(vikkhambhanappahanam eva), i.e., temporarily through the attainment of jhāna, while the Buddha recommended the attainment of stream-entry, which eliminates identity view by way of eradication(samuccheda)so that not \t\teven the subtle underlying tendency(anusaya)remains, thus ensuring full liberation in a maximum of seven more lives."
