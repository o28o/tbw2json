    "sn17.7:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.ii.230\"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . Whom should one pierce with a dart smeared in poison, bhikkhus? A trainee upon whom come gain, honour, and praise while he has not yet reached his mind's ideal.[n.32] Be and Se read: Kaṁ bhikkhave diddhagatena visallena sallena vijjhatu? The reading in Ee is less satisfactory.Spk:Diddhagatenā ti gatadiddhena(Spk-pṭ:acchavisayutta ti va diddhe gatena);visallena ti visamakkhitena; sallena ti sattiya.The rhetorical construction parallels that in the preceding sutta.Visallenais problematic, and we might accept C.Rh.D's suggestionvisa-sallena,thoughdiddha(= Sktdigdha) already conveys the idea of poisoned. See Ja IV 435,26:Saro diddho kalāpaṁ va/Alittaṁ upalimpati.",
    "sn17.7:2": "\"‘Dart,’ bhikkhus: this is a designation for gain, honour, and praise. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
