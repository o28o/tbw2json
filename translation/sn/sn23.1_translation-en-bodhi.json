    "sn23.1:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Radha approached the Blessed One,[n.239] DPPN 2:730 explains that he was a brahmin of Rājagaha who had become a monk in his old age. The Buddha declared him the foremost of those who could inspire ingenuity in others (etadaggaṁ paṭibhāṇakeyyānaṃ;AN I 25,5). He has two verses atTh 33–34(= Dhp 3–4).Spk: Whenever the Tathāgata saw this elder, a subtle topic occurred to him. Thus the Blessed One taught him the Dhamma in various ways. In this saṁyutta, two vaggas have come down by way of questions, a third by way of request, and a fourth by way of intimate discourse (upanisinnakakathā, lit. \"sitting nearby talk\").sn.iii.89paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Māra, Māra.’ In what way, venerable sir, might Māra be?\"[n.240] Spk: Here \"Māra\" is a metaphor for death and the aggregates(maraṇa-māra, khandha-māra).",
    "sn23.1:2": "\"When there is form, Radha, there might be Māra, or the killer, or the one who is killed.[n.41]MMāro vā assa māretā vā yo vā pana mīyati.Spkglossesmāretāwithmāretabbo,but the word is clearly an agent noun with an active sense.Therefore, Radha, see form as Māra, see it as the killer, see it as the one who is killed. See it as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, as misery, as real misery. Those who see it thus see rightly.",
    "sn23.1:3": "\"What, venerable sir, is the purpose of seeing rightly?\""
