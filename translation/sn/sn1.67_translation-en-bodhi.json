    "sn1.67:2": "v.16\"The world is ensnared by craving;It is enveloped by old age;The world is shut in by death;The world is established on suffering.\"[n.15]Spk: The world is ensnared by craving(taṇhaya uḍḍito)because the eye, caught withthe rope of craving, is ensnared on the peg of forms; so too with the ear and ensnared on the peg of forms; so too with the ear and sounds, etc. The world is shut in by death(maccuna pihito): Even though the kamma done in the last life is only one mind-moment away, beings do not know it because they are shut off from it, as if by a mountain, by the strong pains occurring at the time of death."
