    "sn22.39:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is practising in accordance with the Dhamma,[n.5] Dhammānudhammapaṭipanna.Spk:Navannaṃ lokuttaradhammānaṃ anulomadhammaṃ pubbabhāgapaṭipadaṃ paṭipannassa;\"when he is practising the preliminary portion of the practice that is in conformity with the ninefold supramundane Dhamma (the four paths, their fruits, and Nibbāna).\" Cp. II, n. 34.this is what accords with the Dhamma: he should dwell engrossed in revulsion towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness.[n.52]Rūpe nibbidābahulaṃ vihareyya. Nibbidā,\"revulsion,\" is usually taken to refer to an advanced level of insight, which follows knowledge and vision of things as they really are (seeSN2.23and II, n.69). Spk explains \"fully understands\" by way of the three kinds of full understanding (see n.42), and \"is freed\"(parimuccati)as meaning \"freed through the full understanding of abandonment arisen at the moment of the path.\" Alternatively, we might take the former as the arahant's full knowledge of the first noble truth, the latter as the liberation from future rebirth ensured by the eradication of the taints.One who dwells engrossed in revulsion towards form … and consciousness, fully understands form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. One who fully understands form … and consciousness is freed from form,sn.iii.4feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. He is freed from birth, aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; freed from suffering, I say.\""
