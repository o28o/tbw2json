    "sn17.32:1": "… \"Because his mind was overcome and obsessed by gain, honour, and praise, Devadatta's wholesome root was cut off….\"[n.333] The three wholesome roots are nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion.Spkexplains this to mean that the wholesome roots have been cut off to such an extent that Devadatta is incapable of taking rebirth in heaven or of achieving the path and fruit; it does not mean that his wholesome roots have been permanently eradicated. The next two suttas state the same meaning using different terms."
