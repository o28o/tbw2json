    "sn45.174:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these four knots. What four? The bodily knot of covetousness, the bodily knot of ill will, the bodily knot of distorted grasp of rules and vows, the bodily knot of adherence to dogmatic assertion of truth.[n.47]Spkexplains \"bodily knot\"(kaāyagantha)as a knot in the name-body(nāmakāya), a defilement which knots and connects(ganthanaghaṭanakilesa). Spk-pṭ: A defilement which produces connection, bondage, known as the binding to suffering through the connection of cause with effect, of the round of kamma with the round of results. The fourth knot,idaṁsaccābhinivesa kāyagantha,is literally \"the bodily knot of adherence to (the view) ‘This (alone) is truth.’\"sn.v.60These are the four knots. This Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these four knots, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.\""
