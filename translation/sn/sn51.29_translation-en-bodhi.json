    "sn51.29:1": "Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: \"Venerable sir, what now is spiritual power?

What is the way leading to the development of the bases for spiritual power?\"The Buddha’s answers are exactly the same as in §9.sn.v.288"
