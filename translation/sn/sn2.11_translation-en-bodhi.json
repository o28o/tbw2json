    "sn2.11:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Candimasa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove,sn.i.52approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn2.11:2": "v.90\"They will surely reach to safetyLike deer in a mosquito-free marsh,Who, having attained the jhānas,Are unified, discreet, mindful.\"[n.160]Spkglosses kacche va in pāda b by kacche viya, \"like an armpit\" (Spk-pṭ: in the sense of a cramped place). Spk:Kaccha(used metaphorically) means either a cramped mountain pass(pabbatakaccha)or a constriction in a river(nadikaccha).",
    "sn2.11:3": "v.291\"They will surely reach the far shoreLike a fish when the net is cut,Who, having attained the jhānas,Are diligent, with flaws discarded.\"[n.161]Spk: With flaws discarded(raṇañjaha): with defilements discarded(kilesañjaha). In MLDB, in the translation ofMN No. 19,araṇais rendered \"nonconflict\" or \"without conflict,\" andsa-raṇa\"with conflict.\" However, while in both Pali and Sanskritraṇacan mean battle or conflict, the Pali commentators consistently gloss it withraja-kilesa,\"dust, defilement.\" Thus Ps V 2 hassa-raṇo ti sarajo sakileso, araṇo ti arajo nikkileso.See too v.585cand n.98."
