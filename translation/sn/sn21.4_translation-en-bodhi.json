    "sn21.4:1": "At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a certain newly ordained bhikkhu, after returning from the alms round, would enter his dwelling after the meal and pass the time living at ease and keeping silent.

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported this matter to him.",
    "sn21.4:2": "Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: \"Come, bhikkhu, tell that bhikkhu in my name that the Teacher calls him.\"",
    "sn21.4:3": "Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in that bhikkhu's mind, addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, do not find fault with this bhikkhu. This bhikkhu is one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant dwelling in this very life. And he is one who, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.\"",
    "sn21.4:4": "This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:",

At Ja I 72, Māra is shown mounting his elephant Girimekha before going to attack the future Buddha under the Bodhi Tree."
