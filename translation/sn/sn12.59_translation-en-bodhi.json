    "sn12.59:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of consciousness.[n.5]Viññāṇassa avakkanti.AtDN II 63,2–4it is said that if consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb, name-and-form would not take shape in the womb.

    "sn12.59:2": "\"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree, and all its roots going downwards and across would send the sap upwards. Sustained by that sap, nourished by it, that great tree would stand for a very long time. So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of consciousness … . Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.",
    "sn12.59:3": "\"When, bhikkhus, one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, there is no descent of consciousness. With the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form … . Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.",
    "sn12.59:4": "\"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree. Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the tree at its foot … he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. Thus that great tree would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising."
