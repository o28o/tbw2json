    "sn1.41:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain devata of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn1.41:2": "v.136\"When one's house is ablazeThe vessel taken outIs the one that is useful,Not the one left burnt inside.",
    "sn1.41:3": "v.17\"So when the world is ablazeWiththe fires ofaging and death,One should take outone's wealthby giving:What is given is well salvaged.sn.i.2",
    "sn1.41:4": "v.139[n.96] Ee2, again on the testimony of the Lanna mss, precedes this verse with another one on the unpredictability of death, found also at Ja II 58. But if the verse were originally part of the text,Spkwould surely have incorporated here the commentary on it found, with the verse itself, at Vism 236–37 (Ppn 8:29–3). Since there are strong reasons against the inclusion of the verse, I have passed over it in this translation.\"What is given yields pleasant fruit,But not so what is not given.Thieves take it away, or kings,It gets burnt by fire or is lost.",
    "sn1.41:5": "v.140\"Then in the end one leaves the bodyAlong with one's possessions.Having understood this, the wise personShould enjoy himself but also give.Having given and enjoyed as fits his means,Blameless he goes to the heavenly state.\""
