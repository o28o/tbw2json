    "sn49.1-12:1": "At Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One said this: \"Bhikkhus, there are these four right strivings. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecay, increase, expansion, and fulfilment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings.[n.245] The terms of the formula are explained according to the sutta method at Vibh 208–0, commented on at Vibh-a 289–96; see too Vism 679 (Ppn 22:35). Briefly: The evil unwholesome states are greed, hatred, delusion, and the defilements associated with them; desire(chanda)is wholesome wish-to-do, wholesome righteous desire; effort, energy, and striving are all terms for energy(viriya); mind is defined by the standard register of terms for citta. The wholesome states are nongreed, nonhatred, nondelusion, and their concomitants. The Abhidhamma analysis, at Vibh 2–4, treats right striving as the energy factor in the supramundane paths, which accomplishes all four functions simultaneously.",
    "sn49.1-12:2": "\"Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four right strivings slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.",
    "sn49.1-12:3": "(The remaining suttas of this vagga are to be similarly elaborated).",
    "sn49.1-12:4": "Six about slanting to the eastAnd six about slanting to the ocean.These two sixes make up twelve:Thus the subchapter is recited."
