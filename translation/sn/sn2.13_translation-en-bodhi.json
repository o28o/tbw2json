    "sn2.13:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Dighalaṭṭhi, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Bamboo Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:",
    "sn2.13:2": "v.94\"A bhikkhu should be a meditator,One who is liberated in mind,If he desires the heart's attainment,Bent on that as his advantage.Having known the world's rise and fall,Let him be lofty in mind and unattached.\""
