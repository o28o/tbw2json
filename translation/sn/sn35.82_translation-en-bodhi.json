    "sn35.82:1": "Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the world, the world.’ In what way, venerable sir, is it said ‘the world’?\"",
    "sn35.82:2": "\"It is disintegrating, bhikkhu, therefore it is called the world.[n.45]Lujjatī ti kho bhikkhu tasmā loko ti vuccati.Spk: The five aggregates are called thus because it is their nature to disintegrate(lujjanasabhavatta).Lokais derived fromlujjatiin this sutta. The etymology cannot be accepted literally but serves a pedagogic purpose. On the six sense bases as \"the world,\" seeSN35.116.And what is disintegrating? The eye, bhikkhu, is disintegrating, forms are disintegrating, eye-consciousness is disintegrating, eye-contact is disintegrating, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … that too is disintegrating. The ear is disintegrating … The mind is disintegrating … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is disintegrating. It is disintegrating, bhikkhu, therefore it is called the world.\""
