    "sn40.8:1": "… \"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.\" What now is the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception? ’",
    "sn40.8:2": "\"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallana, Moggallana, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. Steady your mind in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, unify your mind in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, concentrate your mind in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.’ Then, on a later occasion, by completely transcending the base of nothingness, I entered and dwelt in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception."
