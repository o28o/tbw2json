    "sn42.9:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One, while wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, arrived at Nalanda.sn.iv.323He stayed there at Nalanda in Pavarika's Mango Grove.",
    "sn42.9:2": "Now on that occasion Nalanda was in the grip of famine, a time of scarcity, with crops blighted and turned to straw.[n.347] I follow von Hinüber's proposals regarding the correct reading and interpretation of these terms in his paper, \"The Ghost WordDvı̄hitikāand the Description of Famines in Early Buddhist Literature.\" The reading, firstly, should be:Nālandā dubbhikkhā hoti duhitikā setaṭṭikā salākāvuttā.All extant mss, it seems, have been contaminated bydvīhitikāandsetaṭṭhikā,thoughSpkrecognizesduhitikāas a v.l. here and other texts on crop failure preservesetaṭṭikā(Vin II 56,1–3 =AN IV 78,8–79,). While Spk explains bothdvīhitikāandduhitikāas derived fromdu-īhiti(ordu-ihiti,\"difficult faring\"), the correct derivation is fromdu-hita(see n.1above). The corrupt readingsetaṭṭhikāis explained by Spk as meaning \"white with bones,\" i.e., with the bones of people who have perished in the famine, but other commentaries identifysetaṭṭikāas a crop disease(rogajāti)caused by insects that devour the pith of the grain stalks. The word is analysedseta-aṭṭi-kā,\"the white disease,\" because the afflicted crops turn white and do not yield grain (see Sp VI 191,5–7 = Mp IV 136,16–18; Sp I 175,4–8).On that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nataputta was residing at Nalanda together with a large retinue of nigaṇṭhas. Then Asibandhakaputta the headman, a lay disciple of the nigaṇṭhas, approached Nigaṇṭha Nataputta, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nataputta then said to him: \"Come, headman, refute the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama. Then a good report concerning you will be spread about thus: ‘Asibandhakaputta the headman has refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is so powerful and mighty.’\"",
    "sn42.9:3": "\"But how, venerable sir, shall I refute the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is so powerful and mighty?\"",
    "sn42.9:4": "\"Venerable sir, doesn’t the Blessed One in many ways praise sympathy for families, the protection of families, compassion for families?\"",
    "sn42.9:5": "When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, venerable sir! … From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.\""
