    "sn46.99-110:1": "[n.20] Ee wrongly numbers these suttas \"99–00,\" which throws off the subsequent numbers. (Feer has corrected this error in his introduction to Part 5, p. v.) The following errors in Ee's numbering scheme should also be noted: Ee's block \"00–0 (–2)\"—corresponding to my \" ()-20 (0)\"—counts twelve suttas though there are only ten. (The summary verse in Be includestaṇhā-tasināya,but as the two are merged only ten suttas are counted.) Ee's block \"54–64 (–0)\"—corresponding to my block \"65 ()-74 (0)\"—has the right number of suttas but numbers them as if there were eleven.\"Bhikkhus, just as whatever strenuous deeds are done …\"",
    "sn46.99-110:2": "Strenuous, seeds, and nāgas,The tree, the pot, the spike,The sky, and two on clouds,The ship, guest house, and river."
