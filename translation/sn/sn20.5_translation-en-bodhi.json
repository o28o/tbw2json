    "sn20.5:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, suppose there was a sharp-pointed spear, and a man would come along thinking: ‘I will bend back this sharp-pointed spear with my hand or fist, twist it out of shape, and twirl it around.’[n.364]Spkexplains the three verbs thus:paṭileṇeti,having struck the top, bending it like a cotton wick, one makes it fuse together as if it were a strand of resin;paṭikoṭṭeti,having struck it in the middle and bent it back, or having struck it along the blade, one makes the two blades fuse together;paṭivaṭṭeti,turning it around as if making a cotton wick (?), one twirls it around for a long time, unravels it, and again twirls it around.What do you think bhikkhus, would it be possible for that man to do so?\"",
    "sn20.5:2": "\"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has developed and cultivated the liberation of mind by lovingkindness, made it a vehicle, made it a basis, stabilized it, exercised himself in it, and fully perfected it, if a nonhuman being thinks he can overthrow his mind, that nonhuman being would only experience fatigue and vexation."
