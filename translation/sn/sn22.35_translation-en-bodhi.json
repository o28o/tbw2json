    "sn22.35:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.iii.35Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.\"",
    "sn22.35:2": "\"In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?\"",
    "sn22.35:3": "\"Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief. If, bhikkhu, one has an underlying tendency towards form …as above in full… then one is not reckoned in terms of it. It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail.\"",
    "sn22.35:4": "Then that bhikkhu, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement,sn.iii.36rose from his seat, and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.",
    "sn22.35:5": "Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, that bhikkhu, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: \"Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.\" And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.[n.48] See I, n.376."
