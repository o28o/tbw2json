    "sn22.150:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, do pleasure and pain arise internally?\"[n.230]Spkglosseskiṁ upādāyawithkiṁ paṭicca,but a word play is probably involved; see n.46. The double sense would then be that pleasure and pain arise because one clings to the five aggregates with desire and lust, and they arise in dependence on the five aggregates as their support and object.sn.iii.8"
