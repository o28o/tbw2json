    "sn40.3:1": "… \"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the third jhāna, the third jhāna.\" What now is the third jhāna?’",
    "sn40.3:2": "\"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallana, Moggallana, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the third jhāna. Steady your mind in the third jhāna, unify your mind in the third jhāna, concentrate your mind in the third jhāna.’ Then, on a later occasion, with the fading away as well of rapture, I dwelt equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experienced happiness with the body; I entered and dwelt in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily. ’"
