    "sn41.2:1": "On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Macchikasaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder approached those elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to them: \"Venerable sirs, let the elders consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.\"",
    "sn41.2:2": "Then Citta the householder approached the elder bhikkhus, paid homage to them, sat down to one side, and said to the venerable chief elder:",
    "sn41.2:3": "Now on that occasion the Venerable Isidatta was the most junior bhikkhu in that Saṅgha.[n.289]Th120is ascribed to Isidatta. According to Th-a I 248, while Isidatta was still a layman, his \"unseen friend\" Citta (see next sutta) sent him a letter in which he praised the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. Isidatta gained confidence in the Triple Gem, went forth as a monk under the Venerable Mahakaccana, and quickly attained arahantship with the six direct knowledges.Then the Venerable Isidatta said to the venerable chief elder: \"Allow me, venerable elder, to answer Citta the householder's question.\"",
    "sn41.2:4": "Then Citta the householder, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Isidatta's words, with his own hand served and satisfied the elder bhikkhus with the various kinds of delicious food. When the elder bhikkhus had finished eating and had put away their bowls,[n.290]Onītapattapāṇino.HereSpkexpands: \"Having removed their bowls from their hands and washed them(paṇīto apanītapattā dhovitvā), having deposited them into their bags, (they left) with the bowls hanging from their shoulders.\" This explanation goes further than the more typical commentarial gloss, which interprets the expression to mean simply that the monk has put the bowl aside; see n.135. Onosāpeti,“to deposit,” see I, n.223.they rose from their seats and departed."
