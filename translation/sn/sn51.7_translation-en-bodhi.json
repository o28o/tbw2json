    "sn51.7:1": "\"Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhus in the past, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life entered and dwelt in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, all did so because they had developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power. Whatever bhikkhus in the future, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life will enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, all will do so because they will have developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power. Whatever bhikkhus at present, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, all do so because they have developed and cultivated the four bases for spiritual power.",

He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving."
