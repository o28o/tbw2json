    "sn5.6:1": "At Sāvatthī. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Cala dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.[n.350] Cala, Upacala, and Sīsupacala—whose verses appear in5:6–8respectively—were the younger sisters of Sāriputta, in descending order of age. Their verses are atThī 82–88, 89–95,and96–203\". However, not only is the correspondence between the two collections fragmentary, but the ascriptions of authorship also differ. Cala's v. 537 corresponds toThī 9, and v. 538 is reflected obscurely inThī 92, both of which are there ascribed to Upacala. Upacala's vv.540–43correspond toThī 97, 98, 200, and 20, there ascribed to Sīsupacala. And Sīsupacala's vv.544–46correspond toThī 83–85, but there are ascribed to Cala.",
