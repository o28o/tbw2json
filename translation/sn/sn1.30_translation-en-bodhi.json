    "sn1.30:1": "v.76\"Having approached you, we ask a questionOf the slender hero with antelope calves,Greedless, subsisting on little food,Wandering alone like a lion or nāga,Without concern for sensual pleasures:How is one released from suffering?\"[n.57] This verse of inquiry occurs atSn65–66, though with an additional couplet and with a variant line in place of the actual question. The inquirers there are the two yakkhas, Hemavata and Satagira. The question (or rather, string of questions) is posed only at verse (Sn)68 and the reply given at (Sn)69; they are identical with the question and reply at vv.22–22. It is only after receiving this reply that the yakkhas pose the present question,kathaṁ dukkha pamuccati?,and the answer given is identical. Having antelope calves(eṇijaṅgha)is one of the thirty-two marks of a great man (seeDN III 56,5–2;MN II 36,4). Onnāga,seeSN.37 n. 84.",
    "sn1.30:2": "v.77\"Five cords of sensual pleasure in the world,With mind declared to be the sixth:Having expunged desire here,One is thus released from suffering.\"[n.58]Spk: Here: in this name-and-form(namarūpa). By mentioning the five cords of sensual pleasure, form is indicated (Spk-pṭ: because they have the nature of form). By mind(mano), name(nama), i.e., the four mental aggregates, is indicated. Thus the basis (of desire) here can be interpreted by way of the five aggregates, etc."
