    "sn11.23:1": "At Sāvatthī. The Blessed One said this: \"Bhikkhus, once in the past Vepacitti, lord of the asuras, was sick, afflicted, gravely ill.[n.662]Spk: He was afflicted with the illness that arose at the time he was cursed by the group of seers; see vv.902–3.Then Sakka, lord of the devas, approached Vepacitti to inquire about his illness. Vepacitti saw Sakka coming in the distance and said to him: ‘Cure me, lord of the devas.’ -sn.i.239‘Teach me, Vepacitti, the Sambari magic.’[n.663]Sambarimaya.MW has two relevant listings:śambaramaya= sorcery, magic; andśambari= jugglery, sorcery, illusion (as practised by the daitya Śambara).- ‘I won’t teach it, dear sir, until I have asked the asuras for permission.’",
    "sn11.23:2": "v.943\"‘A magician—O Maghava, Sakka,King of devas, Suja's husband—Goes to the terrible hell,Like Sambara, for a hundred years.’\"[n.665] As C.Rh.D points out (at KS 1:305, n. 4), in this verse Vepacitti makes a distinction between Sambara and himself. Even thoughSpkidentifies the two, the commentator does not seem to be bothered by the discrepancy but paraphrases the verse: \"Just as Sambara, lord of the asuras, a magician who practised magic, was tortured in hell for a hundred years, so one who applies his magic is tortured.\" Spk-pṭ offers some further help with Sambara: \"Sambara was the former head of the asuras, the originator(adipurisa)of the asura magic.\"Spk continues: \"Was Sakka able to cure him of his anger? Yes, he was able. How? At that time, it is said, the group of seers was still living. Therefore Sakka would have brought him to them and made him apologize, and he would then have become healthy. But because of his perverse nature(vañcitatta)he did not comply but simply left.\""
