    "sn41.7:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Godatta was dwelling at Macchikasaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.sn.iv.296Then Citta the householder approached the Venerable Godatta, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Godatta then said to him as he was sitting to one side:[n.308] Godatta's verses are atTh 659–72. The conversation that follows is also atMN I 297,9–298,27, with Sāriputta and Mahakoṭṭhita as the speakers.",
    "sn41.7:2": "\"And what, venerable sir, is the method by which these things are different in meaning and also different in phrasing? Here a bhikkhu dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill will. He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill will. This is called the measureless liberation of mind.[n.309]Spk: There are twelve kinds of measureless liberation of mind(appamāṇā cetovimutti): the four divine abodes, the four paths, and the four fruits. The divine abodes are called \"measureless\" because of their measureless radiation (towards countless beings), the paths and fruits because they remove the defilements, the causes of measurement.",
    "sn41.7:3": "\"And what, venerable sir, is the liberation of mind by nothingness? Here, by completely transcending the base of the infinity of consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. This is called the liberation of mind by nothingness.[n.10]Spk: There are nine kinds of liberation of mind by nothingness(ākiñcaññ̄ā cetovimutti): the base of nothingness, and the four paths and fruits. The first is called \"nothingness\" because it does not have any \"something\" (impediment; see n.15just below) as object, the paths and fruits because of the nonexistence in them of the excruciating and obstructive defilements.",
    "sn41.7:4": "\"And what, venerable sir, is the liberation of mind by emptiness? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut, reflects thus: ‘Empty is this of selfsn.iv.297or of what belongs to self.’ This is called the liberation of mind by emptiness.[n.311]Spkdoes not gloss this, but it seems the expression \"liberation of mind by emptiness\"(suññatā cetovimutti)is used to signify concentration based on insight into the selfless nature of phenomena and also the supramundane paths and fruits.",
    "sn41.7:5": "\"And what, venerable sir, is the signless liberation of mind? Here, with nonattention to all signs, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the signless concentration of mind. This is called the signless liberation of mind.[n.312]Spk: There are thirteen kinds of signless liberation of mind(animittā cetovimutti): insight—because it removes the \"signs\" of permanence, happiness, and self; the four formless attainments—because the sign of form is absent in them; and the four paths and fruits—because the defilements, the \"makers of signs,\" are absent in them.",
