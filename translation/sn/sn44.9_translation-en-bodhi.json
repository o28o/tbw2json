    "sn44.9:1": "Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:",
    "sn44.9:2": "\"In recent days, Master Gotama, a number of ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers of various sects had assembled in the debating hall and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them:[n.380]Spkexplainskutūhalasālā(lit. \"commotion hall\") as a place where ascetics and brahmins of other sects engage in various discussions. It is so named because commotion arises as they say, \"What does this one say? What does that one say?\"The teachers mentioned are the famous \"six heretics,\" the rivals of Gotama (see SN3:1 n00). It is strange that predictions about rebirth are ascribed to Ajita, since elsewhere he is reported to have taught materialism and to have denied an afterlife. Even Sañjaya is reported to have been a sceptic about such issues.‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa—the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people—declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus: \"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there.\" And in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who had attained the supreme attainment, when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus: \"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there.\"",
    "sn44.9:3": "This Makkhali Gosāla … This Nigaṇṭha Nataputta … This Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta … This Pakudha Kaccāyana … This Ajita Kesakambalī … when that disciple has passed awaysn.iv.99and died he also declares his rebirth thus: \"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there.\"",
    "sn44.9:4": "This ascetic Gotama—the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people—declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus: \"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there.\" But in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who had attained the supreme attainment, when that disciple has passed away and died he does not declare his rebirth thus: \"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there.\" Rather, he declares of him: \"He cut off craving, severed the fetter, and, by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering.\"’",
    "sn44.9:5": "\"It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Vaccha, it is fitting for you to doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. I declare, Vaccha, rebirth for one with fuel, not for one without fuel. Just as a fire burns with fuel, but not without fuel, so, Vaccha, I declare rebirth for one with fuel, not for one without fuel.\"[n.381]Sa-upādānassa khvāhaṃ Vaccha upapattiṃ paññāpemi no anupādānassa.There is a double meaning here, withupādānameaning both \"fuel\" and subjective \"clinging,\" but I have translated the sentence in consonance with the following simile. It was also in a discourse to Vacchagotta that the Buddha used his famous simile of the fire that goes out from lack of fuel to illustrate the status of one who has attained Nibbāna; seeMN72(MN I 487,11–30).",
    "sn44.9:6": "\"Master Gotama, when a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance, what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasion?\""
