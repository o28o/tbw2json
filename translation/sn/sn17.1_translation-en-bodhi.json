    "sn17.1:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus!\"sn.ii.226",
    "sn17.1:2": "\"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise, bitter, vile, obstructive to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage.[n.316]Spk: Gain (lābha) is the gain of the four requisites; honour(sakkara), the gain of (requisites) that are well made and well produced; praise(siloka), acclamation(vaṇṇaghosa).Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon the arisen gain, honour, and praise, and we will not let the arisen gain, honour, and praise persist obsessing our minds.’ Thus should you train yourselves.\""
