    "sn24.7:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view as this arise:[n.256] The doctrine of noncausality(ahetukavāda)is ascribed to Makkhali Gosāla atDN I 53,25–33,but atSN22.60a portion of it is attributed to Pūraṇa Kassapa; see above n.92. For the commentary, seeFruits of Recluseship,pp. 70–72. Strict determinism(niyativāda)is known to have been the main plank of Makkhali's Ājīvika philosophy, discussed in detail by Basham,History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas,pp. 224–39. The sentence in brackets is brought in fromDN I 53,28–29,but is not in the SN text or in the version atMN I 56,33–57,3.‘There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition. (There is no action by self, no action by others, no manly action.) There is no power, no energy, no manly strength, no manly exertion. All beings, all living beings, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, and energy; moulded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes?\"[n.257] The six classes(chaḷabhijātiyo)—the black, the blue, the red, the yellow, the white, and the ultimate white—represent stages along the Ājīvika road to perfection; seeFruits of Recluseship,pp. 73–75. AtAN III 383,8–84,7this scheme is ascribed to Pūraṇa Kassapa, which again shows the connection between the two systems (a point noted by Basham, pp. 23–24).",
    "sn24.7:2–3": "\"When there is form, bhikkhus, when there is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings … they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes.’ …",
    "sn24.7:4": "\"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has abandoned perplexity in these six cases …sn.iii.211… he is then called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer … with enlightenment as his destination.\""
