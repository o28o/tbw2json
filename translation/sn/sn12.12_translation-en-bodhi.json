    "sn12.12:1": "At Sāvatthī.sn.ii.3\"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to be. What four? The nutriment edible food, gross or subtle; second, contact; third, mental volition; fourth, consciousness. These are the four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to be.\"[n.20]Spk: The Blessed One stopped the teaching at this point because he knew that a theorist(diṭṭhigatika)was sitting in the assembly and he wanted to give him an opportunity to ask his questions.",
    "sn12.12:2": "When this was said, the Venerable Moḷiyaphagguna said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, who consumes the nutriment consciousness?\"[n.1]Spkexplains that the name \"Moḷiya\" was given to him in lay life because he wore his hair in a huge topknot(moḷi), and the nickname stuck with him after he went forth as a monk. AtMN1he is admonished by the Buddha for his excessively familiar relations with the bhikkhunis; inSN1.3it is announced that he has left the Order and returned to lay life.",
    "sn12.12:3": "\"Venerable sir, who makes contact?\"",
    "sn12.12:4": "\"Venerable sir, who feels?\"",
    "sn12.12:5–6": "\"Venerable sir, who craves?\"",
    "sn12.12:7": "\"But, Phagguna, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact comes cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.\""
