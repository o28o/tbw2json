    "sn27.1:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, desire and lust for the eye is a corruption of the mind.[n.273]Cittass’ eso upakkileso.Spk: A corruption of what mind? The mind of the four planes. Admittedly, it is so for the mind of the three (mundane) planes, but how is it a corruption of the supramundane mind? By obstructing its arising. For it is a corruption because it does not allow that mind to arise.Although the title of the chapter haskilesa,which I render \"defilement,\" the body of the text usesupakkilesa,which I render \"corruption.\"MN I 36–37enumerates sixteen \"corruptions of mind,\" whileSN46.33applies this designation to the five hindrances.Desire and lust for the ear … for the nose … for the tongue … for the body … for the mind is a corruption of the mind. When a bhikkhu has abandoned the mental corruption in these six cases, his mind inclines to renunciation. A mind fortified by renunciation becomes wieldy in regard to those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge.\"[n.274] Spk: His mind inclines to renunciation(nekkhammaninnaṁ c’ assa cittaṁ hoti): The mind of serenity and insight inclines to the nine supramundane states. Those things to be realized by direct knowledge(abhiññā sacchikaraṇiyesu dhammesu): the things pertaining to the six direct knowledges. Spk does not gloss the verbkhāyati,lit. \"appears.\""
