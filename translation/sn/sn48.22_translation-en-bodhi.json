    "sn48.22:1": "\"Bhikkhus, there are these three faculties. What three? The femininity faculty, the masculinity faculty, the life faculty. These are the three faculties.\"[n.205] The femininity faculty(itthindriya)and the masculinity faculty(purisindriya)are rarely mentioned in the Nikāyas, but play an important role in a sutta atAN7.5. The two are included among the types of derivative form(upādā rūpa)in the Abhidhamma; they are defined at Dhs §§633–34 and Vibh 22–23, and commented on at As 32–23 and Vism 447 (Ppn 4:58).Spksays the femininity faculty exercises control over femininity (i.e., determines the distinctive feminine features of a female); the masculinity faculty exercises control over masculinity. The life faculty(jīvitindriya)is another type of derivative form, responsible for maintaining conascent physical phenomena. It is defined at Dhs §635 and Vibh 23 and commented on at As 323 and Vism 447 (Ppn 4:59)."
