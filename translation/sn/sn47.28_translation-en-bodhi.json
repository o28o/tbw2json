    "sn47.28:1": "The same setting. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:",
    "sn47.28:2": "What four? Here, friend, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. It is, friend, because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I directly know this thousandfold world.\"[n.174]Sahassaṁ lokaṁ abhijānami.Spk: This is stated by way of his constant dwelling. For after rising in the morning and washing his face, the elder sits in his dwelling and recollects a thousand aeons in the past and a thousand aeons in the future (sic; no comment from Spk-pṭ). In regard to the thousandfold world system in the present, he follows its course just by adverting to it. Thus with the divine eye he directly knows the thousandfold world."
