    "sn44.1:1": "On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the bhikkhunī Khema,[n.373] AtAN.236(AN I 25,9) she is declared the foremost bhikkhunī among those with great wisdom(etadaggaṁ mahāpaññānaṁ), and atSN7.24she is extolled as a model for the other bhikkhunīs. For a biographical sketch, see Hecker, \"Great Woman Disciples of the Buddha,\" in Nyanaponika and Hecker,Great Disciples of the Buddha,pp. 263–66, and Pruitt,Commentary on the Verses of the Therīs,pp. 64–74.while wandering on tour among the Kosalans, had taken up residence in Toraṇavatthu between Sāvatthī and Saketa. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, while travelling from Saketa to Sāvatthī, took up residence for one night in Toraṇavatthu between Saketa and Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a man thus: \"Go, good man, and find out whether there is any ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom I could visit today.\"",
    "sn44.1:2": "\"Yes, sire,\" the man replied, but though he traversed the whole of Toraṇavatthu he did not see any ascetic or brahmin there whom King Pasenadi could visit. The man did see, however, the bhikkhunī Khema resident in Toraṇavatthu, so he approached King Pasenadi and said to him:",
    "sn44.1:3": "\"Sire, there is no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom your majesty could visit. But, sire, there is the bhikkhunī named Khema, a disciple of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Now a good report concerning this revered lady has spread about thus:sn.iv.75‘She is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, a splendid speaker, ingenious.’ Let your majesty visit her.\"",
    "sn44.1:4": "Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the bhikkhunī Khema, paid homage to her, sat down to one side, and said to her:",
    "sn44.1:5": "\"How is this, revered lady? When asked, ‘How is it, revered lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?’ … And when asked, ‘Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?’—in each case you say: ‘Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this.’ What now,sn.iv.376revered lady, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?\"",
    "sn44.1:6": "\"Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river Ganges thus: ‘There are so many grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many thousands of grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand’?\"",
    "sn44.1:7": "\"That feeling by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe himsn.iv.3…",
    "sn44.1:8": "That perception by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him … Those volitional formations by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him … That consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.",
    "sn44.1:9": "The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness; he is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean. ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’ does not apply.\"",
    "sn44.1:10": "Then, on a later occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:",
    "sn44.1:11–12": "\"Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician …all as above down to:sn.iv.379…",
