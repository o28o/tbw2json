    "sn9.4:1": "On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain woodland thicket. Then, when they had spent the rains there, after the three months had passed those bhikkhus set out on tour. Then the devata that inhabited that woodland thicket, not seeing those bhikkhus, lamenting, on that occasion recited this verse:",
    "sn9.4:2": "v.770\"Today discontent appears to meWhen I see here so many vacant seats.Where have they gone, Gotama's disciples,Those splendid speakers rich in learning?\"[n.539] Geiger has caught the sense: \"It seemed to the devata that discontent with the monastic life had overcome the bhikkhus and they had given it up\" (GermTr, p. 311, n. ). Onaratisee n. 486.",
    "sn9.4:3": "When this was said, another devata replied in verse:",
    "sn9.4:4": "v.771\"They’ve gone to Magadha, gone to Kosala,And some are in the Vajjian land.Like deer that roam free from ties,The bhikkhus dwell without abode.\"[n.50]Spk: Just as deer, wandering in the foothills or woodland thickets, wander wherever they find pleasant pastureland and dangers are absent, and have no attachment to their parents’ property or a family heirloom, so the homeless bhikkhus, without fixed abode, wander wherever they can easily find suitable climate, food, companionship, lodgings, and Dhamma-teachings, and have no attachment to the property of their teacher and preceptor or to a family heirloom."
