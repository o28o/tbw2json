    "sn17.22:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . Bhikkhus, even though the most beautiful girl of the land, when one is alone with her, may not persist obsessing one's mind, still gain, honour, and praise might persist obsessing one's mind. So dreadful, bhikkhus, are gain, honour, and praise … . Thus should you train yourselves.\""
