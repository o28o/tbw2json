    "sn8.6:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk,spokenwith speech that was polished, clear, articulate, expressing well the meaning. And those bhikkhus were listening to the Dhamma with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, directing their whole mind to it.",
    "sn8.6:2": "Then the Venerable Vangisa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and, raising his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Venerable Sāriputta, said to him: \"An inspiration has come to me, friend Sāriputta! An inspiration has come to me, friend Sāriputta!\"",
    "sn8.6:3": "v.71\"Deep in wisdom, intelligent,Skilled in the true path and the false,Sāriputta, of great wisdom,Teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.",
    "sn8.6:4": "v.732\"He teaches briefly,He speaks in detail.His voice, like that of a myna bird,Pours forth inspired discourse.[n.512]Spkparaphrases pāda c as if it contained an implicit verbhotiand treats pāda d as an independent sentence withpaṭibhanaṁas subject. It seems more fitting, however, to takenigghosoin pāda c as the subject ofudirayiandpaṭibhanaṁas its object, and I translate accordingly. Spk explains the simile: \"The elder's sweet voice, as he teaches the Dhamma, is like the voice of a myna bird when, having tasted a sweet ripe mango, it strikes up a breeze with its wings and emits a sweet sound.\" Spk glosses the verb withuṭṭhahati,and paraphrases with an intransitive sense: \"Inspired discourse rises up (from him) endlessly, like waves from the ocean.\" This implies that Spk readsudiyyati,the Be reading ofTh 1232.",
    "sn8.6:5": "v.733\"As he teaches them, they listenTo his sweet utterance.Uplifted in mind, made joyfulBy his delightful voice,Sonorous and lovely,The bhikkhus incline their ears.\""
