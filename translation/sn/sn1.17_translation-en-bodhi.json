    "sn1.17:2": "v.33\"How many days can one practise the ascetic lifeIf one does not rein in one's mind?One would founder with each stepUnder the control of one's intentions.[n.6]Spkexplains pade pade, in pāda c, thus: \"In each object(arammaṇe arammaṇe); for whenever a defilement arises in relation to any object, it is just there that one founders(visidati). But the phrase can also be interpreted by way of the modes of deportment(iriyapatha); if a defilement arises while one is walking,(standing, sitting, or lying down), it is just there that one founders. Intentions(saṅkappa)should be understood here by way of the three wrong intentions, i.e., of sensuality, ill will, and harming.\"",
    "sn1.17:3": "v.4\"Drawing in the mind's thoughtsAs a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell,Independent, not harassing others, fully quenched,A bhikkhu would not blame anyone.\"[n.27] The simile of the tortoise is elaborated atSN5.240, followed by the same verse.Spk: One is independent(anissito)of the dependencies of craving and views, and fully quenched by the quenching of defilements(kilesaparinibbāna). He would not reprove another person for defects in conduct, etc., from a desire to humiliate him, but he would speak out of compassion, with the idea of rehabilitating him, having set up in himself the five qualities (speaking at the right time, about a true matter, gently, in a beneficial way, with a mind of lovingkindness; seeAN5.198)."
