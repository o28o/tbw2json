    "sn4.21:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at sīlavati. Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute. Then Māra the Evil One manifested himself in the form of a brahmin, with a large matted topknot, clad in an antelope hide, old, crooked like a roof bracket, wheezing, holding a staff ofudumbarawood.[n.302]Spk: \"The staff ofudumbarawood, slightly crooked, was for the sake of showing that he was of few wishes(appicchabhava,an ascetic virtue).\" In the Vedic sacrifices,udumbarawood was used for all kinds of ritual purposes; the sacrificial post, ladle, and amulets were made of this wood (Macdonell and Keith,Vedic Index,s.v.udumbara).He approached those bhikkhus and said to them: \"You, sirs, have gone forth while young, lads with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, without having dallied with sensual pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures, sirs; do not abandon what is directly visible in order to pursue what takes time.\"[n.303] SeeSN.20. Here Māra appears as a proponent of the brahmanical idea that renunciation(sannyasa)must be postponed until after one has enjoyed a full married life. On how young bhikkhus, lads \"in the prime of life, who have not dallied with sensual pleasures,\" can live the holy life without being overcome by sensual desire, seeSN35.27.",
    "sn4.21:2": "Then those bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported everything in full.The Blessed One said:",
    "sn4.21:3": "\"That was not a brahmin, bhikkhus. That was Māra the Evil One, who had come in order to confound you.\"",
    "sn4.21:4": "v.88\"How could a person incline to sensual pleasuresWho has seen the source whence suffering springs?Having known acquisition as a tie in the world,A person should train for its removal.\"sn.i.119"
