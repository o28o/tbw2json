    "sn35.89:1": "Then the Venerable Bahiya approached the Blessed One … and said to him: \"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.\"",
    "sn35.89:2–15": "\"What do you think, Bahiya, is the eye permanent or impermanent?\" - \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" …as in §32 down to:sn.iv.64… \"He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’\"",
    "sn35.89:16": "Then the Venerable Bahiya, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the Venerable Bahiya, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: \"Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.\" And the Venerable Bahiya became one of the arahants."
