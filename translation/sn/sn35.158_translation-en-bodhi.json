    "sn35.158:1": "\"Bhikkhus, attend carefully to the eye.[n.55] This sutta and the next are parallel toSN22.52.Recognize the impermanence of the eye as it really is. When a bhikkhu, attending carefully to the eye, recognizes the impermanence of the eye as it really is, he feels revulsion towards the eye. With the destruction of delight comes destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is said to be well liberated.sn.iv.43"
