    "sn2.25:1": "Thus have I heard. On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling among the Kosalans in a little forest hut on a slope of the Himalayas—restless, puffed up, personally vain, rough-tongued, rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, loose in their sense faculties.[n.76]Spk: Restless(uddhata): of a restless temperament because of perceiving what is unallowable and blameworthy as allowable and blameless (according to the Vinaya), and the converse. Puffed up(unnaḷa): full of hollow conceit like an erect (pithless) reed. Personally vain(capala): by adorning their bowls and robes, etc.Mukhara = mukhakhara(\"mouth-rough\"): of rough speech. Rambling in their talk(vikiṇṇavaca): of uncontrolled speech, chattering away pointlessly all day long. Muddle-minded(muṭṭhassatino): with lost mindfulness, devoid of mindfulness, forgetful of whatever they have done. Without clear comprehension(asampajana): without wisdom. Unconcentrated(asamahita): devoid of access and absorption concentration, like a ship cast about by a fierce current. Scatter-brained(vibbhantacitta,lit. \"with wandering minds\"): like foolish deer on a road. Loose in their sense faculties(pakatindriya):with open faculties due to lack of restraint, just as when they were laymen.",
    "sn2.25:2": "Then, on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the young deva Jantu approached those bhikkhus and addressed them in verses:[n.177]Spk: The young deva realized that his exhortation would not be effective if he approached each monk individually, and thus he approached them when they had assembled for the Uposatha day observance (seen. 513).",
    "sn2.25:3": "v.5\"In the past the bhikkhus lived happily,The disciples of Gotama.Without wishes they sought their alms,Without wishes they used their lodgings.Having known the world's impermanence,They made an end to suffering.",
    "sn2.25:4": "v.35\"But now like headmen in a villageThey make themselves hard to maintain.They eat and eat and then lie down,Infatuated in others’ homes.[n.178]Spk: Through infatuation by defilements (Spk-pṭ: by craving), they are infatuated with the daughters-in-law, etc., in the homes of others.",
    "sn2.25:5": "v.3\"Having reverently saluted the Saṅgha,I here speak only about some:They are rejected, without protector,Become just like the dead.[n.179] in pāda b, I readvadamahaṁ,with Be, Se, and Ee2, as against Ee1vandamahaṁ.Ee1 has the former reading in the parallel v.794b.Spk: As dead bodies, thrown into the charnel ground, are eaten by various predators and even their relatives do not protect them or guard them, so such men are rejected, without protector, in that they do not get any instruction or advice from their preceptors and teachers. They are just like the dead.",
    "sn2.25:6": "v.35\"My statement is made with referenceTo those who dwell in negligence.As for those who dwell in diligence,To them I humbly pay homage.\""
