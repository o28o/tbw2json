    "sn45.139:1–4": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, whatever beings there are—whether those without feet or those with two feet or those with four feet or those with many feet, whether consisting of form or formless, whether percipient,sn.v.42nonpercipient, or neither percipient nor nonpercipient—the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is declared to be the chief among them. So too, whatever wholesome states there are, they are all rooted in diligence, converge upon diligence, and diligence is declared to be the chief among them.[n.37]Spk: Diligence is called the chief of all wholesome states because it is by diligence that one acquires all the other wholesome states.When a bhikkhu is diligent, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."
