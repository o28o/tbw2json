    "sn17.24:1": "At Sāvatthī. \"Bhikkhus, dreadful are gain, honour, and praise … . A faithful female lay follower, rightly imploring her only daughter, dear and beloved, might implore her thus: ‘Dear, you should become like Khujjuttarā the lay follower and Veḷukaṇḍakiyā, Nanda's mother’—for this is the standard and criterion for my female disciples who are lay followers, that is, Khujjuttarā the lay follower and Veḷukaṇḍakiya, Nanda's mother.[n.329] Khujjuttarā was the foremost female lay disciple among those who have learned much, Veḷukaṇḍakiyā (or Uttarā) Nandamātā the foremost of the meditators; seeAN I 26,9, 2. Khema and Uppalavaṇṇā, mentioned just below, were the foremost bhikkhunis in regard to wisdom and spiritual power, respectively. Uppalavaṇṇā has appeared atSN5:5, and Khema gives a discourse atSN44:.‘But if, dear, you go forth from the household life into homelessness, you should become like the bhikkhunīs Khema and Uppalavaṇṇā’—for this is the standard and criterion for my female disciples who are bhikkhunīs, that is, Khema and Uppalavaṇṇā. ‘While, dear, you are a trainee, one who has not yet reached her mind's ideal, may gain, honour, and praise not come upon you!’"
