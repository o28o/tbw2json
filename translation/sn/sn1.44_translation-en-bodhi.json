    "sn1.44:1": "v.47\"The seer has crossed over the abyssWith its one root, two whirlpools,Three stains, five extensions,An ocean with twelve eddies.\"[n.98]Spkexplains the riddle thus: The ocean or abyss(patala)is craving, called an ocean because it is unfillable and an abyss because it gives no foothold. Its one root(ekamūla)is ignorance; the two whirlpools(dviravaṭṭa)are the views of eternalism and annihilationism. (Spk-pṭ: Craving for existence revolves by way of the eternalist view; craving for extermination by way of the annihilationist view.) The three stains(timala)are lust, hatred, and delusion; the five extensions(pañcapatthara), the five cords of sensual pleasure; and the twelve eddies(dvadāsavāṭṭa), the six internal and external sense bases. ñāṇananda proposes an alternative interpretation of some of these terms: with reference toSN36.4, he takes the abyss to be painful feeling, and with reference toSN35.228, the ocean to be the six sense faculties. The two whirlpools are pleasant and painful feeling; the one root, contact. For details see SN-Anth 2:63–66.sn.i.33"
