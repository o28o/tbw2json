    "sn3.10:1": "Now on that occasion a great mass of people had been put in bondage by King Pasenadi of Kosala—some with ropes, some with clogs, some with chains.[n.26]Spkrelates, as the background story, an abridged version of the prologue to Ja No. 92. The verses appear, however, also atDhp 345–46, the commentarial background story to which states merely that the king had ordered the criminals brought before him to be bound with fetters, ropes, and chains. See Dhp-a IV 53–55; BL 3:223–24. The same story is in the prologue to Ja No. 20.sn.i.77",
    "sn3.10:2": "Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed … and said to the Blessed One: \"Here, venerable sir, a great mass of people have been put in bondage by King Pasenadi of Kosala, some with ropes, some with clogs, some with chains.\"",
    "sn3.10:3": "Then the Blessed One, having understood the meaning of this, on that occasion recited these verses:",
    "sn3.10:4": "v.397\"That bond, the wise say, is not strongMade of iron, wood, or rope;But infatuation with jewellery and earrings,Anxious concern for wives and children",
    "sn3.10:5": "v.398This, the wise say, is the strong bond,Degrading, supple, hard to escape.But even this they cut and wander forth,Unconcerned, having abandoned sensual pleasures.\"[n.217]Spk: It is degrading(oharina)because it drags one down to the four realms of misery; supple(sithila), because unlike iron bonds it does not constrict one's physical movement but holds one in bondage wherever one goes; hard to escape(duppamuñca), because one cannot break free from it except by supramundane knowledge."
