    "sn40.1:1": "On one occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.sn.iv.263There the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Friends, bhikkhus!\"[n.276] The first nine suttas of this saṁyutta report Moggallana's experiences during his week-long struggle for arahantship immediately after his ordination as a bhikkhu. For another account of his development, seeAN IV 85–88, and for a connected narrative, see Hecker, \"Mahāmoggallāna: Master of Psychic Powers,\" in Nyanaponika and Hecker,Great Disciples of the Buddha,pp. 78–83.",
    "sn40.1:2": "\"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘It is said, \"the first jhāna, the first jhāna.\" What now is the first jhāna?’",
    "sn40.1:3": "\"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this: ‘Moggallana, Moggallana, do not be negligent, brahmin, regarding the first jhāna. Steady your mind in the first jhāna, unify your mind in the first jhāna, concentrate your mind in the first jhāna.’ Then, friends, on a later occasion, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelt in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion."
