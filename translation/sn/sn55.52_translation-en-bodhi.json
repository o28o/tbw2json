The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard: \"A certain bhikkhu, it is said, who spent the rains in Sāvatthī has arrived in Kapilavatthu.\"",

    "sn55.52:7": "\"Further, friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learnt this: ‘Those bhikkhus are few who … have become once-returners. … Those bhikkhus are more numerous who, with the utter destruction of three fetters, have become stream-enterers, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination.’\""
